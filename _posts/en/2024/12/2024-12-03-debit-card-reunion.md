Due to several months of delayed credit card payments, a total of five cards were automatically canceled.

I have owned about 15 credit cards in total. The reason for this is to maximize benefits like reward points for each service. For instance, using an Amazon Mastercard for shopping on Amazon or a View Card for Suica charges.

However, points are meaningless unless used, and when they're dispersed across multiple credit cards, it becomes tedious to keep track of and eventually they expire without being used—a situation I've encountered many times.

This time, the points were forfeited simultaneously due to non-payment. I probably had about 3,000 yen accumulated, but that’s now unusable.

Realizing that even using points feels cumbersome for me indicates that multiple credit cards are not suited for my lifestyle, and failing to pay them on time means I don’t deserve to use them. While a common warning, it’s worth noting that since credit card payments are delayed by over a month, it dulls the sense of spending money, often resulting in overspending. Despite checking details daily with Money Forward, I’ve been surprised by my credit card charges: “Did I really spend this much this month?” The fact that it takes several days to confirm the details after using a credit card also subtly contributes to forgetting how much was spent.

Thus, I considered reverting to using a debit card. Initially, as a college student, I used debit cards, switching to credit cards once I started working. The reason I initially switched to credit cards wasn’t to maximize reward points, but due to certain weaknesses of debit cards, which contributes to my current concerns—a topic I’ll discuss later.

Credit cards are essentially a form of credit, delaying the payment. Calculation of incoming funds on the next payday versus outgoing funds is necessary to manage this, but my lazy nature often leads me to buy necessities or splurges on the assumption that I’d rather avoid the regret of buying cheap alternatives. While not inherently negative, if it leads to non-payment, it’s better to save and then purchase. Installment payments are absolutely out of the question.

Debit cards, offering instant settlements, only allow spending within the balance available in your bank account. Therefore, irregular or significant purchases require thorough checks not only of the balance but also of living expenses until the next payday. While minimizing effort is a common wish (for everyone), putting extra care into financial matters cultivates a spending awareness, reducing wasteful expenses. With debit cards, purchases are impossible if the balance is insufficient.

So, I decided to avoid credit cards and manage my finances with a debit card, yet a drawback of debit cards became apparent.

* They generally have lower reward rates and fewer attached services compared to credit cards
* Weak compensation for fraudulent use
* Inability to make payments for subscriptions or utilities
* Often lack transaction details

### Lower Reward Rates and Fewer Attached Services Compared to Credit Cards
While many credit cards offer reward rates of 1% or more, the highest rate found for debit cards is 1%, from Rakuten Debit Card, with others offering just 0.2%, 0.5%, or 0.8%. For someone accustomed to credit cards, this feels insufficient. Yet compared to losing accumulated points or facing automatic switch to revolving payments with service fees due to non-payment, it’s acceptable.

Additionally, credit cards often come with perks like airport lounge access or international protection, rarely seen with debit cards.

### Weak Compensation for Fraudulent Use
Debit card protection tends to be weaker regarding fraud. Credit cards often offer full compensation if fraud can be proven before withdrawal, whereas debit cards rarely provide full compensation, usually setting a cap, such as 1 million yen annually. Rakuten Debit Card shares this limitation.

However, some debit cards allow adjusting monthly spending caps for improved security.

### Inability to Pay for Subscriptions or Utilities
Sometimes, debit cards are not accepted for subscription services. Structurally identical to credit cards, attempting to register them may result in an error stating “unusable credit card.” This limitation also applies to utility bills. This seems due to scenarios where no funds are available at the time of monthly withdrawal, leaving agencies unable to manage payments.

In such cases, using a credit card becomes necessary. If debit cards are primarily preventive measures against overspending in day-to-day or large purchases, compromising by using credit cards solely for regular payments is acceptable, making this less critical.

### Often Lack Transaction Details
A prevalent inconvenience is the lack of transaction details. I use Money Forward to automate my bookkeeping, but debit card use often doesn’t disclose where it was spent. Previously, [when using a debit card](https://github.com/noraworld/diary/blob/1f0823a7be4d8dfb7accc603ce125419d785c166/_posts/2019/04/2019-04-05-.md#%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B8%E3%83%83%E3%83%88%E3%82%AB%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%81%A8%E3%81%9D%E3%81%AE%E9%82%84%E5%85%83%E7%8E%87%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6%E3%81%84%E3%82%8D%E3%81%84%E3%82%8D%E8%AA%BF%E3%81%B9%E3%81%A6%E3%81%84%E3%81%9F), it would appear as “Debit 1 VISA-123456.” This ambiguity in detailing transactions is unsettling for many.

> Although debit transactions are immediately deducted from my bank account, there is seemingly no record of which store was utilized. This makes it difficult to retrospectively determine “what did I spend 5,000 yen on?” even when linked with Money Forward.

> However, only the transaction number appears after “Debit,” not the merchant’s name.

Rakuten Debit Cards reportedly display the merchant name, though delayed by a few days.

> “Rakuten Bank Debit Cards” showcase the store name after about three days delay. Initially, it shows as “Debit 7XXXX,” requiring awareness.

This slight improvement is somewhat helpful, yet when initially imported into Money Forward without identifying details, automatic categorization fails, requiring manual input afterward.

> It appears Money Forward categorizes based on the first import name; when it reads “VISA Debit,” categorization ceases.
> (Although user classification at this stage remains, all subsequent entries reflect ‘food expenses,’ even non-food purchases.)

The primary reason for limiting credit card use is to curb overspending, with automation for expense management contributing to this goal, but cumbersome manual input contradicts the intent. Consistent manual classification burdens the user.

### Rakuten Debit Card Is an Option, but…
Offering a 1% reward rate comparable to credit cards, exceptional spend limit controls, and visibility of usage a few days later makes Rakuten Debit Card an ideal candidate.

With UFJ Bank as my primary bank and past experience with UFJ’s VISA Debit Card, this could be reissued for simplicity. However, it offers a mere 0.2% reward, and as per experience, UFJ VISA Debit doesn’t show user-friendly details. After several days, it merely displays as “Debit 1 VISA-123456,” necessitating manual tracking or personal memos. While records automatically update, it becomes equivalent to managing expenses with cash, losing automation benefits.

While Rakuten Debit Card reportedly displays store names akin to credit cards, the initial delay in transaction visibility evens the comparison. The adjustable limit is a notable advantage.

Moreover, Rakuten Points from Rakuten Debit Card transactions seamlessly allocate to the next debit purchase (usable from 50 points onward), enhancing usability.

This system mitigates fears of point expiration or conversion hassle. It effortlessly accumulates and expends during card usage, minimizing wastage.

Opting to mainly use debit, Rakuten Debit Card stands out; however, acquiring it mandates opening a Rakuten Bank account. For someone new to their services, this poses a unique drawback specific to Rakuten Debit Card. Navigating account transition solely for a debit card seems an inconvenience.

Keeping UFJ as the main account while using Rakuten Bank for daily necessities is feasible yet introduces the hassle of transferring funds between UFJ and Rakuten Bank, urging consolidation for smoother management. Both UFJ and Rakuten Bank offer sub-accounts connected to the main account for savings, eliminating unnecessary fees.

Thus, a significant decision looms. If committing to relinquishing most credit card use (except in exclusive cases), transitioning exclusively to a debit card enables considering Rakuten Bank. However, hesitations linger without firsthand experience: complexity with Money Forward manual categorization, prevalence of incompatible debit services, etc. Risk accompanies major banking transitions.

What should be done?
