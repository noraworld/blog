I'm updating my blog after a long time. Excluding articles I wrote for work at my previous job, this is my first update in two and a half years since the end of March 2022.

Back when I was a student, I was constantly active on Twitter (now X) and other social media, much like a 'tweet addict' (though that term is probably outdated now), but since becoming a working adult, I've pretty much disappeared from online communities. Especially in recent years, with the push for remote work, I've had less social interaction both online and offline.

So, does that mean I haven't been outputting anything at all? Actually, no. I've started writing diaries on GitHub, so I record my daily thoughts and feelings there. Unlike Twitter, there's no character limit to worry about, and I don't have to worry about others seeing it in real time, which makes it easier to express my emotions and thoughts more clearly, so I've mostly been using it as my output.

In the future, I'd like to make this diary on GitHub public, similar to the diary website I used to host on my server, but as exposing my diary in real time would hinder my thought process, it's currently entirely private. Therefore, those who knew me well online from the past probably think I've disappeared from the internet. In fact, I've hardly interacted with acquaintances from university since I stopped using social media.

However, for better or worse, humans are social creatures, and having no interactions with others at all can make life dull and monotonous. Plus, if you remain closed off in a private space (or rather, a mostly solitary space), there's no one there, and nothing new emerges. Even if you're not a famous person, by outputting to the outside world, your work might catch the eye of a few people, leading to interactions. Engaging in output that holds no such possibilities tends to leave one feeling somewhat empty.

I repeat, I do intend to make the diary I'm writing public someday. But I cannot do so in real time. Therefore, I felt the need for a medium through which I can broadcast my thoughts and emotions in real time and not just as scribblings like a diary, but in a form more organized for others to see. Thus, I've decided to restart my blog. Not that I've committed to updating regularlyâ€”I might stop again, who knows?

That's not the only reason I've decided to update my blog. With a diary, it's just about recording random thoughts as they come, so the content tends to be more flow-like information. Therefore, when I have intense feelings or want to compile something as a structured piece of writing, I feel that a blog is more suitable. Particularly recently, since moving to and currently residing in Sydney at the end of July this year, the experience has been completely different from what I imagined. I want to compile these feelings while they are still fresh, which is a significant part of the reason. I plan to summarize this in another article.

There's no point in writing indefinitely, and if I ramble on, the main point may become lost, so I'll leave it at that for now. I shouldn't overexert myself just because it's been a while, as it's likely to be unsustainable. The objective is to express my thoughts, so I'll continue casually without worrying too much about the formality of the writing.

Oh, and since I'm resuming the blog, I hope that adding advertisements might generate some revenue, which could serve as motivation. However, I have the impression that Google AdSense's approval process has become stricter over the years. In fact, when I tried a while ago, I couldn't get approval no matter how many times I tried. So, I don't have high expectations, but I'm considering it lightly, thinking it'd be nice to include ads if possible.
