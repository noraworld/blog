Hello, my name is Nora. Since this is the first post of my blog, I'm a bit unsure about what to write. For now, I’d like to share why I started this blog and give a brief introduction about myself.

### Introduction
Once again, I'm Nora. I am currently a university student. In my university club, I go by this name. I specialize in information studies, learning the basics of programming, computers, and networking. I often appear on Twitter, so I’d be delighted if you could reply to me at <a href="https://twitter.com/noraworld_jp/" target="_blank">@noraworld_jp</a>. I am also on other social media, but I will introduce those on another occasion.

### Why I Started the Blog
Actually, this isn't my first attempt at writing a blog. I started an Ameba blog in high school and quit after about two years. After enrolling in university, I started a new blog, but couldn't keep it going. I ended up repeatedly creating and deleting accounts.

The reason I couldn't keep a blog after starting university was probably because I began to feel it wasn't truly "mine." There are many services like Ameba, Livedoor, and Hatena Blog that offer free blogging platforms, but ultimately, you end up feeling like it’s a "blog offered by Ameba" or "blog offered by Livedoor" and so on, which failed to give me a sense of ownership.

That's why I wanted to create a blog that is truly just mine! This blog is powered by a blogging engine called Ghost, and unlike services like Ameba, it runs on a server that I host myself. From setting up the server to installing Ghost, I did everything myself, making it truly "my blog." I can customize everything and manage the data myself. Additionally, this time I have contracted a domain [blog.noraworld.jp](http://blog.noraworld.jp), which further emphasizes the feeling of it being my own blog!

I acquired a server and domain not just for blogging but to create a webpage to introduce myself and let people know more about me. As someone in the field of information studies, I thought it would be great to have a page to showcase my various works (programs) that I will create and publish on the internet.

Renting a server and owning a domain costs money. Especially since the server is contracted monthly, it's not cheap. However, I believe that having people learn about my creations through a website offers more value than the cost.

Though I digressed a bit, these are the reasons why I decided to start this blog.

### What Kind of Blog This Will Be
I don’t have a clear concept yet. For now, I plan to introduce things I've bought, things I think are great, or write a casual diary-like entry... I aim to shape it into my own original blog, so anything goes.

Since this is my first post, it might come off as a bit stiff, but I'll try to keep things casual from now on. Also, I suffer from a "when I start writing, it ends up as a long essay" syndrome, so my posts might often be long like this one, but I would be really happy if you read them. At times, I will post short articles, and it might even become a blog of mostly short posts. Please keep an open mind and support me!

### In Conclusion
If I keep writing, it might interfere with my part-time job tomorrow, so I'll stop here for now (currently 5:30 AM). The frequency of updates is undecided, but I intend to write leisurely whenever the mood strikes.

See you next time!

(The "Welcome to Ghost" article before this was there from the start. Normally, you delete it and create a new post, but since I’m still unsure about writing in Markdown, I’ll leave it as is. Plus, it looks kind of cool.)
