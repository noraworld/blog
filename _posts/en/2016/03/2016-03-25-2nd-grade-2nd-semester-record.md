University lectures start in April, but today was the day for grade announcements, so I went to the university to receive my report card. By the way, I'm writing this blog in the university library.

### The results were quite satisfactory
I was worried because there were subjects I didn't listen to seriously in class and didn't study enough for, but the results were not as bad as I had feared, so that was good. In particular, I had concerns about Operating Systems since it was a required subject, and failing it would have been detrimental, but thanks to my desperate studying before the exam, I did well in that subject. The subjects for which I attended classes seriously also resulted in personal satisfaction due to the study I put in before the exams.

For the subjects I crammed for the night before the exam, I just managed to earn those credits. Honestly, I couldn't have complained if I'd failed those, so I'm thankful to the professor, thank you very much. However, for the subject Object-Oriented Theory, I hardly attended any classes and didn't even bother to take the exam, thinking it was impossible, so of course, I failed it, LOL.

This was the grade announcement for the second semester of my second year, and I managed to progress to the third year without issues. Based on the credits I've currently acquired, if I continue to earn credits at this pace, I should have secured enough credits for graduation by the time I finish my third year. The fourth year will likely be busy with graduation research, so my goal for this academic year is to have the graduation credits secured by the end of my third year. To achieve this, I need to avoid giving up on subjects like Object-Oriented Theory and skipping examsâ€¦! I'll do my best!

### I received a certificate of commendation
Before receiving the report card, there was a course guidance session where they explained the procedures for course registration, and there was a commendation before the guidance. I had applied for the commendation program before the spring break, and my selection was approved, so I received a commendation!

The content I applied with was the report assignment from the experiment I had in the second semester of my second year. I received a message from the professor encouraging me to apply, so I quickly prepared the PDF file of the report and the application form and submitted them to the office, and I made it through.

I received an email from the university yesterday saying, "Since you passed the selection, you will be commended before the guidance," so I wasn't mentally prepared at all, but I was genuinely happy that my report was recognized. However, the professor in charge of the commendation mispronounced my name, and moreover, that professor was the **instructor for the Object-Oriented Theory (the subject I failed),** so the moment of receiving it was quite awkward...

### All in all
I'm relieved that I was able to advance to the next year successfully, only had one subject to worry about, and most importantly, my grades were better than I anticipated. It looks like I'll be able to spend the third year of university life peacefully.
