Recently, I've mostly been going to work every day, so I haven't gone anywhere other than the station area. But today, I went to a large shopping mall in a different direction from the station and bought Pokémon Omega Ruby.

### Pokémon Omega Ruby

Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire belong to the third generation of Pokémon games. They were released in 2002, right around the time I was in elementary school. Back then, I would play games at home almost every day after school. I'd visit my friends' houses to have Pokémon battles and trades... such nostalgic memories.

Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire are the 3DS remakes of Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire. As one of the Pokémon generation from that time, these games are deeply cherished in my memory.

### Why I Bought Omega Ruby
Actually, I already own Pokémon Alpha Sapphire. In fact, I got it right after it was released. Every Pokémon series always has at least two different packages, and I tend to want them both for my collection, so I end up buying both every time (they got me). However, when I bought Pokémon Alpha Sapphire, I thought I wouldn't play both anyway... so I only bought Alpha Sapphire. Yet here I am, buying Omega Ruby. The reason is, **I wanted Mew.**

To be precise, it felt like a waste to not receive Mew when I had the chance. I had **four** serial codes to receive Mew. I used three of them on Pokémon X and Y and Pokémon Alpha Sapphire that I already owned. And the remaining one... It would be wasteful not to get Mew! → Might as well buy Omega Ruby! And that's how it happened, lol.

### Four Mew Serial Codes
I got these serial codes as a bonus for purchasing the original Pokémon series that were released on the 3DS Virtual Console last month.

Even though I'm a college student now, how many Pokémon games can I buy at my age...←

Well, anyway, the original Pokémon games are four versions: Red, Green, Blue, and Yellow. Each package came with one serial code, so I had a total of four.

I have completed all four types, but I'm not that hardcore into Pokémon; I just play a little here and there when I feel like it.

I have quite a few memories of playing the original Pokémon games too. It's a bit before my generation, but I played them when I was into Pokémon. Back then, I had the Green and Yellow versions, and I played the Yellow version a lot. Having Pikachu follow you around and being able to see Pikachu's expressions when you talk to it felt so new back then.

### Rushed to the Shopping Mall to Buy It
Except for food and household goods, I usually order everything from Amazon. Games are definitely among those. It's often cheaper and sometimes comes with bonuses.

I bought Alpha Sapphire, the Virtual Console version of the original Pokémon, and Pokémon X and Y from Amazon. But for Omega Ruby, I went all the way to a shopping mall to buy it because **the deadline for receiving Mew was today (3/31).**

I got the original Pokémon serial codes, i.e., the Mew serial codes, when they were released in late February. So I had almost a month, but because I was busy with work and didn't have much time to open my 3DS, I hadn't received them yet. But since today was the deadline, I thought it would be a waste not to get them, so I received all four Mews today.

The shopping mall doesn't stock as many games as a game store would, so I didn't know if they had stock or even sold Pokémon games, but I was relieved to find they did.

### The Fear of Collectibility
Writing this article made me realize how terrifying collectibility can be. As I mentioned, I usually only play one (or a few) from a Pokémon series. For example, I completed Pokémon X, but Pokémon Y remained largely untouched. I’ve only progressed in Red on the Virtual Console version of the original Pokémon. Yet, for some reason, I want to have all the versions.

Do any of you have things you just can't help but collect?
