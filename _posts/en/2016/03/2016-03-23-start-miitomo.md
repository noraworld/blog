University students in Japan have nearly a two-month-long spring break, and the lengthy holiday is about to end in just a few days. However, grades are returned before the break ends, which makes me a little nervous. I want to spend the rest of my spring break hoping that I have earned all my credits.

### I Started Miitomo

Recently, I downloaded and started playing Miitomo, released by Nintendo.

When you talk to your Mii, it asks you questions, and you can answer them to share topics with other friends. You can also leave hearts or comments. I've linked it with my Twitter and made friends with my followers and with friends from university.

It's fascinating that I don't have to create topics myself because the Mii prepares them for me. I just need to respond, and I can easily share topics. Plus, when someone agrees with my answers, it makes me feel happy.

I haven't done this yet, but it seems you can buy clothes for your Mii and change outfits, or you can attach your Mii to photos. I feel a bit hesitant about sharing photos with myself on social media, so I think it might be fun to attach my Mii instead and have my own unique photos.

I’ve only just started a few days ago, but it's quite enjoyable. It's not addictive like a game, but it does keep me engaged as I find out what's trending among my circle or discover unexpected sides of my friends.

### A Word of Caution on Friend Requests
I just learned this myself, but while you can tweet about your Mii in a way similar to how I did at the beginning of this post, **you can't send friend requests from a tweet!** If you link your Twitter, you can send friend requests to people you follow, but those who see your Mii introduction on Twitter cannot send requests directly through it. It seems to be solely for introducing your Mii or letting people know you’re on Miitomo.

So, if you're reading this blog and thinking of sending me a friend request, I'd be grateful if you follow me on Twitter first. If you say something like "I saw your blog!" or "Please accept my Miitomo request!", I'd definitely follow you back. So feel free to send a friend request!
