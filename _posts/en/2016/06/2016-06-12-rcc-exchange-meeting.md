I believe that most of the people who read this blog are acquaintances, so when I write university-related articles from now on, I'll skip detailed introductions.

Last Friday, RCC had a welcome exchange meeting. I'm currently a third-year student, but since I joined RCC this year, I was treated as a new member.

At the exchange meeting, we deepened our interactions by introducing ourselves and having casual conversations with others while enjoying sushi and hors d'oeuvres.

Upperclassmen paid 1,000 yen, while new members paid 500 yen. I was considered a new member, so I got to eat for 500 yen! Lucky me!

Both the sushi and the hors d'oeuvres were a luxurious treat since it had been a while.

### Self-introduction
We each introduced ourselves by year, but since I’m very shy and not good at speaking in front of people, the moment I took the mic, all the things I had planned to say went out of my head.

If possible, I’d like to redo my self-introduction...

If this continues, people who don’t know me will just think I'm shy, and personally, I'm not satisfied with not being able to say what I wanted. So, I'll summarize here what I intended to say.

#### “A word to the next person”
WGG asked me, "What's your favorite CP (coupling)?" but I was so nervous I completely forgot, sorry ><

Well, either way, I didn’t understand what CP meant, so I couldn’t have talked about it...

#### About the icon

I use this icon on most SNS and services.

I use this icon as a sort of alter ego and am quite fond of it, but when I held a voting on Twitter about it, 60% of people said it "doesn't look like me." Sad.

#### Why I joined RCC
I barely mentioned that I joined from the third year, but I forgot to say why from the third year.

The original reason I thought about joining RCC was because, during this year’s spring break, Mr. Sako held a Rails study session for RCC and Ripps.

Actually, I belonged to a project group called Ripps in my second year. However, since we weren't very active, Ripps was disbanded in April this year. Reference: [Circle Disbandment and Last Meeting](http://blog.noraworld.jp/circle-breakup/)

As a circle for IT-related activities, there are project groups, but now that I'm in my third year, it's too late to join a project group and I wasn’t particularly interested in project activities...

I’m interested in web-related activities, and when it comes to circles doing web-related things… there’s only RCC! So, after attending a few RCC meetings, I decided to join.

One reason for my decision was that P-chan from the Ripps was connected to RCC, and since I met Mr. Sako at a spring break study session, I thought I could get along well with RCC as a former Ripps member!

It’s said in some places that "Ripps was absorbed into RCC," but since Ripps' leader, Mr. Toyu, is not part of RCC, it's hard to say it was absorbed. In fact, Mr. Toyu is creating iPhone apps and has more technical skills than I do.

Oh, also, P-chan calls the core of Ripps on Twitter, and there's an impression spreading that I'm a "strong person," but that’s not true at all! If overly high expectations aren’t met, it’s tough for both sides, so please… (tremble)

#### About Twitter
My Twitter account is <a href="https://twitter.com/noraworld_jp" target="_blank">@noraworld_jp</a>.

Mr. Utsuroki said, "it’s like a throwaway account ID," but this is my only Twitter account. This is my main account.

On GitHub, Qiita, and the like, my ID is noraworld, and I want to use this ID on all services, but unfortunately, @noraworld is already taken on Twitter and Instagram, orz

I started Twitter in 2012, and at that time, I wasn’t particular about IDs and made mine with nora+ the date I started.

I thought about changing it to @noraworld later and found it was already taken, so I’ve been using my current ID since 2012.

I don’t like this ID very much, so I might change it if I find one I’m satisfied with. For now, I'm using this ID.

### Casual talks
After the self-introductions, it was a chatting session. I talked with Arika-san, the leader of the Hack Credit team, about extensions and credit cards, and met ShuSui-san and Mr. Abe, whom I follow on Twitter. I also met Mr. Patchio.

After the exchange meeting ended, I talked with Mr. Hikko about the laboratory and future advice. I was glad to hear many valuable opinions. Thank you very much.

### Conclusion
Though I failed in my self-introduction, I had a good time. I was glad to talk with people connected to P-chan.

I want to enjoy my activities as an RCC member from here on out!
