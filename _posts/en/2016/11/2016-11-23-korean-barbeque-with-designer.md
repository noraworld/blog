Last night, I went to have yakiniku in Kyoto with a designer from a certain company. I’d like to give a brief overview of our conversation.

### The Reason
The reason I ended up going to dinner with people from the company is that I have an acquaintance working there, who introduced me. It seems that the person from the company asked my acquaintance, “Do you know someone good?” and they recommended me.

The company is based in Tokyo, and I live in the Kansai region. When I heard that people from the company were planning to visit Kyoto, I exchanged email addresses through my acquaintance and was invited to have dinner in Kyoto, which happened yesterday.

### The Talk
I had yakiniku with the designer I exchanged emails with and another designer, making it a party of three. The conversation was divided into two parts, with the first half focused on the company and the latter half on romantic relationships and male talk.

#### About the Company
I’ll keep the name confidential this time, but it is quite a famous company. I had met someone from the HR department (?) at technical events twice (different people each time), but this was my first time meeting someone actually involved in the projects.

They told me a lot about the company, and I definitely felt it’s different from other companies. Rather than just fulfilling assigned tasks, the approach is more about expressing what you want to do and proactively engaging in projects. It left an impression on me that when you say, “I’ll do it!” you are given the opportunity, but you must also take responsibility.

One characteristic is that each department takes responsibility for recruitment. For instance, if an employee from that department wants to hire someone, they can do so. However, for the first year, the person who advocated for hiring has the role of a mentor to nurture that employee. When recruiting, being responsible for developing employees is emphasized.

I got to hear about the company culture, the type of people suited for the company, how they joined, and more. I can't explain everything, but I got valuable insights beyond just the surface level of things like presentations.

#### Male Talk
The topic shifted drastically to discussions about romantic relationships. Questions like, "Do you have a girlfriend?" and "What type of person do you like?" were asked. When I said I don’t have a girlfriend and that I don't have much chance to talk to people since I attend a science-focused university campus, they told me, “That’s not good.”

I am aware that staying like this isn’t ideal, but since I’m not the type to take proactive actions toward people, such opportunities are rare.

Afterwards, perhaps due to the alcohol, the conversation took a turn towards dating apps and meeting people on Twitter. Is that even safe...? Anyway, I realized I lack the drive to act.

### Conclusion
I was nervous about talking with people from the company this time, wondering about what to talk about, which made me mostly just listen, revealing my lack of communication skills. I’m not good at expressing my thoughts either. I thought it would be interesting to discuss technical topics, but since I couldn’t bring up those topics myself, I reflected that I should have tried speaking up more. But it was great to hear valuable stories, and I had a good time.

【Acknowledgments】  
Thank you for inviting me this time. The yakiniku was delicious; thank you very much. 🙏  
Also, I haven’t met the acquaintance who introduced me since getting employed, so when either of us goes to Tokyo or Kyoto, I’d like to meet up. Let’s meet! 😊
