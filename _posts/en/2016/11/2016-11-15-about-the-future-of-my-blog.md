It's been a while. This is the first blog update in about four months. This time, I plan to thoroughly discuss the diary site I began publicizing around summer vacation, the reason I didn't blog for a while because of that, and the reconstruction of my blog theme.

### I Created a Diary Site
On August 10, I created a diary site. [Noraworld Diary](https://diary.noraworld.jp)

On this blog, I wanted to compile events and things I've purchased into fairly polished pieces. I also intended to keep trivial matters confined to Twitter.

However, I found myself wanting a medium for things not significant enough for a blog post, yet too important to let flow away like on Twitter. I desired a site where I could record daily happenings and thoughts in a way akin to a daily journal—more casual in writing but still easily revisitable.

There are many blog platforms and CMS available. This blog uses the Ghost platform, while others like WordPress are globally popular, and lately, there are many static site generators. But I've noticed a lack of platforms focused specifically on writing diaries—something easy to keep daily entries.

Since there wasn't a platform dedicated to this kind of diary writing, I thought, why not build one myself? That's how [Noraworld Diary](https://diary.noraworld.jp) came to be.

I actually started building it before summer break this year (around July) and deployed (published) it a few days into the break. The last few posts of this blog, excluding this one, are from the beginning of July, so I believe that's when I started (though I'm not entirely sure).

While developing the diary site, I was deeply engrossed in the project and didn't blog, and after launching the site, I consistently wrote entries there.

Eventually, I noticed that this blog remained entirely unupdated, and I even started thinking the diary site made the blog redundant.

### Reasons for Shifting to the Diary Site
Why did I end up writing only on the diary site and not on the blog? There are mainly two reasons.

#### Diaries Are Easy to Write
Firstly, the diary site is more casual to write on. As I mentioned earlier, I want this blog to deliver well-crafted articles about events (something other people might find useful when they come across it through a search).

During the 4 months I wasn’t updating, it’s true that there weren’t many notable occurrences to blog about, but there were a few. However, when something did occur, crafting a full-fledged article takes time, and as someone who struggles with writing, I need considerable mental leeway to complete it.

On the other hand, the diary site allows for more casual entries, leading me to frequently choose to write there. Diaries can be like those 3-line journal entries, which often suffice for what I wish to convey.

#### Growing Tired of the Blog
Secondly, I grew a bit tired of this blog. I started using Ghost because a junior coworker was using it and I was captivated by its charm. However, ever since crafting my own diary site, I realized something. Since I didn’t write this blog's backend code, some specifications didn’t align with what I wanted. That’s a notable concern of mine, especially because I love Ghost so much.

### Seeds of Frustration
Thinking along these lines, I started considering creating an entire blog system myself. Why not endeavor to build a self-made CMS and open-source it? However, developing something of a scale like Ghost (usable as a general blogging platform) would take years. It might not even finish within a few years. The diary site was designed with a minimalistic approach, taking shape within a month and a half, but a full-blown blog system is a different story.

Considering that, I realized relying on a platform is indeed simpler to craft a satisfying blog (to roughly 80%). 

### Theme Renewal
What I love about Ghost is its simplicity, the sophisticated and user-friendly dashboard design, and the editability of the blog design. Soon after deploying this blog, I edited its default theme. But that time, it was a makeshift, messy implementation—resulting in untidy code, no tablet-size support, and shortcuts in various details.

It's challenging to find motivation to revisit and fix those details once you’ve stopped. Since I also stopped blogging around July, I consequently continued using the same theme. However, I realized keeping the blog in this neglected state wouldn’t do, so I decided to at least polish its appearance. Recently, I began rewriting the code.

Yesterday, I managed to complete a level of refinement to apply it to this blog. It’s not a completely new design but a rewrite from scratch, so at a glance, changes may not seem apparent. However, it now supports tablet sizes, and several previously concerning details have been addressed. While redesigning doesn’t change the fact that the diary is easier to write, I hope the refreshed design will motivate me to update the blog regularly.

By the way, this design is available on GitHub, so feel free to check it out if you are interested. [Whisper - A generic blog theme for Ghost](https://github.com/noraworld/whisper)

### To Continue with Ghost or Not
In conclusion, I’m not immediately stopping Ghost (this blog). However, many parts of Ghost don’t align well with the functionalities I want, leaving me pondering over possibly moving to a different platform or another way of handling the blog in the future.

If I were more proficient in writing and lived a fulfilling life that continually provides blogable content, a blog would be an excellent outlet. However, except during periods filled with events, I find myself in situations where months go by without updates, questioning its necessity.

Yet, despite my complaints, I do like Ghost. Those mismatches with Ghost are particularly frustrating because I cherish the platform. If a blog platform that suits me better than Ghost emerges, I might switch. Alternatively, I plan to explore anything that catches my interest, but for the time being, I’ll continue to use Ghost.
