As the title suggests, the domain for this blog has been updated. Originally `blog.noraworld.jp`, it is now `noraworld.blog`.

### What is the .blog Domain?
`.blog` is a new top-level domain that was released at 1 AM Japan time on November 22, 2016. So, it just started a mere three days ago and is a brand new domain!

This domain is managed by the WordPress organization and, as the name implies, is intended for use as a blog domain. However, this doesn't mean it's only usable with WordPress; like `.com` or `.jp`, you can get it through a registrar. There are no specific qualifications needed, and anyone can acquire it.

#### Registrars Where You Can Acquire It
I obtained this domain through [Gonbei Domain](http://gonbei.jp). It can also be acquired via [GoDaddy](https://jp.godaddy.com). As of November 25, 2016, it is not available through [Onamae.com](http://www.onamae.com) or [MuuMuu Domain](https://muumuu-domain.com).

【22:03 Update】Onamae.com has also started accepting registrations for `.blog`!

The official site is [get.blog](https://get.blog/ja), but since it's managed by WordPress, I opted not to use it on the off-chance it's intended for WordPress use only. I'm not well-versed in this, so please research thoroughly if you're planning to obtain it from [get.blog](https://get.blog/ja). If anyone knows more, I'd be happy to hear from you.

#### Pricing
The cost at Gonbei Domain is 3,240 yen for both the first and subsequent years. At GoDaddy, it's 2,851 yen for the first year and 4,061 yen for the following years. Considering the long-term costs, Gonbei Domain is cheaper, which is why I chose them. **Please note that these prices are as of the time this article was published and may change.**

【Update】At Gonbei Domain, the first year is 2,592 yen until **12 PM on December 2, 2016**. I registered right after the domain was released, so unfortunately didn't get the reduced rate. What a pity!

#### WHOIS Protection
The `.blog` domain allows for WHOIS protection. However, both Gonbei Domain and GoDaddy currently charge for WHOIS protection, so be aware. Furthermore, if you're considering WHOIS protection, please **don't forget to check the option**.

### In Conclusion
The announcement of this domain came around May, and I've had my eye on it since I first read about it in a news article. After about six months of waiting, I was finally able to get my desired `noraworld.blog` domain!

If you run a blog, this domain is just perfect. In my case, `noraworld.blog` is simpler than `blog.noraworld.jp`, and it clearly indicates it's a blog site.

Since this domain has only recently started, you might not see it around just yet, but I believe it will gain popularity quickly. Domains like `tokyo.blog` have already become premium domains, worth millions of yen.

Even if you don't go after such high-valued domains, domains are first-come, first-served, so there's a possibility that someone else might snag the one you want. If you decide you want a `.blog` domain, I suggest you get it before someone else does.

Thank you for your continued support of Noraworld Blog!
