Today, there was a departmental compa for the RCC (a club). I joined the RCC this year and became part of the System Management Department this semester.

### Kin no Buta
The sysadmin members and I went to Kin no Buta.

It's a shabu-shabu restaurant, so we ate a lot of pork 🐷

I had shabu-shabu with my family this past summer too, but it’s still delicious 😊

The tsukune was delicious too!

The crispy rice was plentiful and tasty.

The carpaccio was refreshing yet oily and tasty.

Mr. Edamame was cannibalizing.

For dessert, I had gelato. The ice cream had a rich grape flavor.

When I write posts like this about food, I always end up saying everything was delicious because my vocabulary is pretty limited. But it really was delicious!

### The Compa's Atmosphere
It cost 4,500 yen per person, but since I’m a new department member, it was free for me. I feel kind of guilty. Thank you very much 😇

There were 11 people in attendance this time, but it wasn’t a loud, rowdy gathering. It was quite a relaxed compa. I don't really like loud parties, so it was a comfortable atmosphere for me.

For about two hours, we ate shabu-shabu and talked about technical topics. It was fun.

In the RCC, there is a culture of calling people by their Twitter names. I thought it was traditional how upperclassmen and junior members, whom I met for the first time at this compa, started their self-introductions by showing their Twitter profiles.

It was amusing to see people using the recently added QR code feature on Twitter to follow each other. Personally, I think sharing an ID would be quicker, but what do you think?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="ja"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">QR読み取りアプリ開いてカメラにQRコードを写すという作業よりも、ID入力したほうが楽なんじゃないかと思うのは自分だけかな…</p>&mdash; のら (@noraworld_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/noraworld_jp/status/799130419694170112">2016年11月17日</a></blockquote>

Also, there are many people whose accounts I know from RTs on Twitter but I don’t know who they actually are. At this compa, I met a senior from RCC I recognized from Twitter but didn’t know personally and had an “Oh, you’re ◯◯!” moment. I enjoy expanding my circle of acquaintances like this.

### Conclusion
I don’t often have the opportunity to participate in compas like this, so it was refreshing to chat for a long time and eat good food. I say opportunities like this are rare, but actually, I’ve been invited to yakiniku next week, so it’s going to be a luxurious week 😄

I plan to write about next week in my blog or diary as well.
