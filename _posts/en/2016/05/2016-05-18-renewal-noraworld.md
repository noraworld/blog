Here's a quick announcement.

We've renewed our homepage! The URL is http://noraworld.jp.

http://noraworld.jp was launched around the same time as this blog, but its design was rather plain.

Since creating the blog, I've really enjoyed editing its design, which led to the homepage being neglected for a while.

But I felt it was a waste to have a homepage and not use it, so I started working on the site a little while ago.

It's not yet responsive to mobile devices, so it's not complete, but since the basic pages are done, I decided to renew it as a PC version for now.

I don't have much of a design sense, and I feel the new page is still kind of plain... but I'm slowly learning to design and hope to create a stylish design once I gain more experience!

I'll update the page when I create new apps. Also, mobile support will be added gradually, so until then, I appreciate it if you check it out on a PC.

Good night. (AM 3:30)
