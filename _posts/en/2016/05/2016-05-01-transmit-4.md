While looking for a good app to directly operate server files, I discovered a convenient application called <a href="https://panic.com/jp/transmit/" target="_blank">Transmit 4</a>, which I would like to introduce.

This app is paid, and I initially used the trial version (for one week). I thought it was great, so I bought it right away even though the free period hadn't ended yet. Let me introduce the particularly convenient aspects of Transmit 4 roughly.

### What is Transmit 4?
Transmit 4 is an FTP file transfer tool for Mac. If you want to edit files on a server without using a file transfer tool, it's common to connect to the server via SSH from a console and use an editor like vi.

However, when connecting to the server from the console, you can't perform graphical operations (GUI) like you can locally. Therefore, you can't use GUI-based text editors.

Also, while starting a web server with an application framework in the console, you can't enter commands, so you need to stop the web server to edit files.

Of course, you could split the screen, run the web server on one side, and edit on the other, but since I'm not very proficient with CUI operations, I'd prefer to work graphically with a GUI-based editor that I'm familiar with.

This is where an FTP file transfer tool becomes convenient. With this, you can manage server files using a GUI similar to Finder and also use a GUI-based editor.

### The Great Things About Transmit
Besides Transmit, there are many FTP file transfer tools. On Windows, FFFTP is famous, and on Mac, Cyberduck. This is my first time using a file transfer tool, so I haven't used any others. So, even if other apps have these features as well, I'll focus on what I personally found easy to use with Transmit.

* You can save server connection destinations to favorites
* You can register frequently accessed folders as shortcuts
* The folder hierarchy is easy to understand
* **You can create new folders/files from the context menu**

#### You can save server connection destinations to favorites

For servers you frequently access, you can pre-register IP addresses, usernames, passwords, port numbers, connection protocols, etc., so you can access them with just a click from the favorites tab next time.

#### You can register frequently accessed folders as shortcuts

When the folder hierarchy gets deep and you frequently go back and forth, it can be a hassle. By registering frequently accessed folders in a place called "places," you can jump to that folder in one go.

#### The folder hierarchy is easy to understand

In Mac's Finder, the hierarchy structure isn't displayed unless you click a button, which can be a bit inconvenient when you want to go back 2-3 levels at once. Sometimes I wish Finder had a hierarchy structure like Ubuntu's file manager...

In Transmit, just like Ubuntu's file manager, the hierarchy structure is displayed, so it's easy to see where you are, and you can easily move to the previous level by clicking.

#### You can create new folders/files from the context menu

Personally, this is the most valuable feature. The context menu has an option for **creating a new file**!

I am a big fan of Mac, and I use it every day. One of my few minor complaints about the beloved Mac is that Finder doesn't have a new file creation menu.

I also introduced an extension app to add a file creation menu in Finder, but you have to select the file format every time, and the format is fixed to text files, requiring a manual change of extensions, which is not very convenient.

However, with Transmit's new file creation menu, there's no need to select a file format or manually input the extension. You just enter the file name including the extension, and it automatically converts to that file format.

This feature might be the reason I decided to purchase Transmit immediately (if you know of a Finder extension app with this user experience, please let me know!)

### There's More
That's the gist of it. I'll also introduce some other features I found surprisingly nice.

* Launch the default app (text editor) with a double-click
* Easy file exchange between local and server
* SFTP (SSH FTP) connection is possible, ensuring security
* It can connect to servers with public key authentication (without password authentication)
* Changes are immediately reflected upon saving
* It can be mounted as a disk

Opening a GUI-based editor with a double-click is something you can only do with a file transfer tool. Vi and nano are great, but using the editor you usually use to edit local files speeds up work.

I forgot to prepare an image, but initially, Transmit's screen is split into two parts: local files on one side and server files on the other, allowing for easy file exchange between the local and server with drag-and-drop. It's handy when you want to transfer a logo image created locally to the server.

Security also seems reliable, with SSL-supported communications even for FTP and possible SFTP connections. Raw FTP communications are not very security-friendly, so being able to communicate with encryption is a plus.

Additionally, my server uses key authentication instead of password authentication for security reasons, and many people might do the same. It's designed to work in such scenarios as well.

As I mentioned, you can edit server files with a GUI-based text editor, and the changes are immediately reflected upon saving. "Immediately" is a vague term, but after starting the web server on the server side and saving with a text editor, simply reloading in the browser reflects the updates. It's like editing a local file without any sense of server reflection time delay.

Finally, I haven't tried this myself, but apparently with Transmit, you can mount the server's disk on your Mac and edit server files directly from Finder. To use this feature, a special disk function must be installed, but once it's operational in Finder, you can handle server files just like local files.

### Attention Points in Transmit
I didn't particularly find any downsides, so I'll summarize points to watch out for and some personal concerns.

* It's a Mac-only app (you can't use it on Windows)
* Connecting to a live server still feels scary

Since I use a Mac regularly, there's no problem for me, but do note that this app is Mac-only, so be careful when purchasing it (don't buy it if you only have Windows, or you'll regret it haha).

Currently, I'm only using it to connect to a Vagrant server (virtual server). While I understand it's secure, I still feel some resistance connecting to a live server.

So, my plan is to use Transmit to edit files on the local server and, once complete, transfer them all at once to the live server for publication.

### Conclusion
After all the fuss, I found it convenient and liked it enough to buy it instantly.

Vagrant allows you to install various packages in a Linux environment without messing with your Mac disk, making it appealing for easy use, but handling local and server file exchanges becomes an issue.

Since introducing Transmit, the efficiency of working with a virtual server has drastically improved. If you find editing files on a virtual server and exchanging them with local files inconvenient, I highly recommend it.

Currently, Transmit 4 is a bit pricey at 3,400 yen, but I think it's worth the purchase.
