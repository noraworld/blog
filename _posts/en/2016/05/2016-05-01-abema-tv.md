Recently, AbemaTV has become quite a hot topic, and today I tried it out for the first time.

### What’s Impressive About AbemaTV
Here's a brief overview.

* No need for membership registration or login
* Available for free instantly (some content and features may require payment)
* Abundant channels

#### No Need for Membership Registration or Login
Many of today's services are easy to use and convenient, but most require user registration or are designed to be more convenient once registered. 

However, with AbemaTV, there is no registration. You simply access the site and click on a program to watch. It’s so straightforward that I sometimes think having a login function to recommend programs might be better.

#### Available for Free Instantly (Some Content and Features May Require Payment)
Basically, it’s free. However, you'll need to pay a monthly fee if you want on-demand access or to watch past broadcasts.

Still, it's quite impressive that you can watch anime, which typically costs money, for free. How can they manage to offer anime for free? Maybe there's some clever strategy behind it.

#### Abundant Channels
Even a quick glance reveals a variety of channels, including variety shows, sports, news, and anime.

As of 18:00 on May 1st (Sunday), you can watch broadcasts from 23 channels.

What's really impressive is the anime. There are multiple channels just for anime, including regular anime, late-night anime, and family anime, among others. They even broadcast nostalgic anime that ended long ago, making it quite the time thief.

There are commercials inserted at various intervals, but that’s just like television broadcasts, and I don't mind at all because they’re offering such extensive content for free.

Instead of explaining with words, it’s faster to check it out for yourself if you’re interested.

From here, I'll share a little trivia.

### Why "AbemaTV"?
It's a service co-funded by TV Asahi and CyberAgent, the company behind the Ameba Blog and Ameba Pigg, so one might wonder why it's not "AmebaTV" instead of "AbemaTV".

This has been discussed on various news sites. <a href="http://iwb.jp/why-cyberagent-new-service-is-abematv/" target="_blank">The Reason Why the New Service is Named AbemaTV Instead of AmebaTV</a>

In short, there was already a service named AmebaTV overseas, and the domain ameba.tv was taken.

When you visit <a href="http://ameba.tv" target="_blank">http://ameba.tv</a>, it redirects you to <a href="http://www.amebatv.com" target="_blank">http://www.amebatv.com</a>, leading you to a foreign site that streams children’s anime.

The president mentioned his “regret” over the name AbemaTV in a blog post. <a href="http://ameblo.jp/shibuya/entry-12149511518.html" target="_blank">The Launch of AbemaTV and an Apology</a>

It certainly isn’t an easy name to remember and is easy to confuse. I even once mistyped the address and ended up on the AmebaTV site, haha.

There might actually be a strategy to gain popularity through its difficult-to-remember name.

### About the Recommended Environment
It seems AbemaTV uses Flash. I don’t have Adobe Flash Player installed on my PC, but since I usually use Google Chrome, I was able to watch it without problems.

When I tested watching with other browsers without Flash Player installed, it played for the first second in Safari before freezing, and in Firefox, it was choppy and unwatchable.

It seems it doesn’t work properly without Flash Player installed. Their recommended environments list Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and IE, so it should work fine with Flash Player installed.

For those like me who are against Flash Player, I recommend using Google Chrome. When accessing with browsers like Firefox without Flash Player installed, a message urging the use of Chrome appears.

![AbemaTV Chrome Recommended](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/abema-tv/abematv_chrome_recommended.png)

This was displayed in Firefox and Opera. It didn’t appear in Safari for some reason.

As a side note, despite not having Flash Player installed and not being listed in AbemaTV's recommended environments, nor having such warnings displayed, I was able to watch smoothly with Opera in my environment.

While I have no idea why, as it isn’t recommended, installing Flash Player or using Chrome is probably wise.

### Conclusion
After living alone, I completely stopped watching TV. I spend every day watching my favorite videos on YouTube or Nico Nico Douga and then going to bed.

Recently, I've run out of videos to watch on YouTube or Nico Nico Douga and have been spending nights not wanting to sleep or do anything at all, just bored.

With AbemaTV, I can watch my favorite broadcasts from a multitude of channels, which might solve these problems.

Watching AbemaTV while working might also be nice. Combined with Panel Tabs, it's unbeatable. [Always Keep a Specific Site on Top with the Extension Panel Tabs](http://blog.noraworld.jp/panel-tabs/)

From now on, when I run out of videos to watch on YouTube or Nico Nico Douga, I’ll turn to AbemaTV.

### Bonus
I don’t watch TV, and I don’t watch anime at all. The only anime I watch is NARUTO, but the next story isn’t even available at the DVD rental shop, so I’m on standby.

While experimenting with AbemaTV, I got curious about anime and peeked just a bit. For the first time, I watched an anime called “Love Live.”

It seems to be quite popular and appears everywhere, so I knew the name, but this was actually my first time watching it. I only watched a few minutes, so I have no idea about the storyline or what kind of anime it is.

However, because it’s famous, and everyone’s watching it, and since AbemaTV offers it for free, maybe this will be my opportunity to start watching anime too.
