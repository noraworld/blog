As I found myself creating websites more frequently as a personal hobby, I wanted to create original icons, so I decided to buy the popular vector drawing application called "Sketch 3."

<a href="http://www.sketchapp.com/" target="blank">Sketch</a>

It's apparently quite popular among designers. The app that's overwhelmingly recognized and popular is Photoshop, but Photoshop is an expensive app that costs several thousand yen a month.

Although Sketch is also paid, once you purchase it, you don't need to pay any more, making it a pretty good deal. As of May 2016, Sketch costs $99 (including various fees, about 12,000 yen).

I initially had no intention of buying it, but I wanted to create chic designs, and when I tried the free trial, I found it easy to use, so I ended up purchasing it.

Even someone like me who can't design managed to create fairly cool logos and designs by fiddling around with it.

This is the logo for http://noraworld.jp. I wasn't consciously aiming for anything, but as I was creating it randomly, it turned out looking like Wikipedia's logo. (But when I checked Wikipedia's logo, it didn't actually look that similar, haha.)

Since it's nora**world**, I designed a globe-shaped icon to represent the world, and the central **n** stands for **n**oraworld. The array of ominous-looking characters in the background is to give the impression of "I'm doing programming (Web)!" by snipping a part of jQuery code. Finally, I added shadows around the circular perimeter and **n** to make it look embossed.

![Mac Folder Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/sketch-3/folder.png)

This is a folder icon used on http://noraworld.jp. I created it by mimicking Mac's folder icons. Sketch allows for a great deal of tweaking, making it ideal for logo creation.

It's only been a short time since I started using it, so I can only manage basic operations, but I'm hoping to get used to it gradually and create stylish logos!

By the way, Sketch has a site where you can publish your logos for anyone to see, so if you're ever stuck for design ideas or want to be inspired by chic designs, I highly recommend checking it out.

Additionally, there are many chic logos and designs on a site called Dribbble, so if you're stuck for design ideas, it's also a good idea to take a look.
