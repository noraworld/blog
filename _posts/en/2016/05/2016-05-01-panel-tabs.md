I watched AbemaTV for the first time today and thought it would be nice to work while watching it. So, I looked for an extension that could keep a certain website on top, and I found a perfect solution.

### Panel Tabs

Panel Tabs is a Chrome extension that prevents the window from getting hidden behind others, even when it's not the active tab, as shown in the screenshot above.

You can freely change the size and have it displayed in the bottom right corner while working on other tasks.

Moreover, you can set shortcuts to send the current tab to a panel tab or return something from a panel tab to the original Chrome window using just the keyboard. I've set it to use Alt+W to send the current tab to a panel tab and Alt+Q to move it back to the original window.

This allows you to work while watching AbemaTV, YouTube, or NicoNico!

### Slightly Inconvenient Points
While I'm satisfied as this is exactly the extension I wanted, there are a few usability issues.

* It can only be placed in the bottom right corner (if placed elsewhere, it gets hidden behind the window)
* It doesn't remember the window size, so you need to reset it each time
* You need to enable Chrome's special settings

These special Chrome settings are apparently called hidden flags and can be accessed if you use Google Chrome by going to chrome://flags.

There is a warning when you access it stating that these are experimental features and are not guaranteed to work correctly.

To enable Panel Tabs, you need to activate the panel setting, which might require some caution.

I've enabled this setting and used it without any issues so far, so I don't think there's much to worry about (probably).

Since it can only be placed in the bottom right, and the window size doesn't stay, it might be improved with future updates. I'm looking forward to those updates!

It's available for Google Chrome. I couldn't find it for other browsers at the moment, but there might be other extensions with similar features.
