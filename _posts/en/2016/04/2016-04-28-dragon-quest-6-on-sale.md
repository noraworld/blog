Recently, I've been writing a lot of technical articles, but I want to actively update my blog with entertainment topics like games whenever I can!

### Dragon Quest 6 On Sale!

Dragon Quest 6, released as an iPhone app, is on sale from today, April 28th (Thu) to May 8th (Sun), reduced from 1,800 yen to 1,200 yen.

The smartphone versions of Dragon Quest from 1 to 8 have been released, and I've purchased all except for 1 and 6.

I actually bought all the Dragon Quest apps I currently own during sales. Since I don't usually play games, I don't buy paid game apps, but I plan to master Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy someday, so I bought them all during sales.

Sales don't happen frequently, but they often occur during release anniversaries or events. I wonder if there's some event happening this time?

Since 6 is on sale this time, I'll buy an iTunes card and make the purchase within the sale period. It seems that 1 was on a free sale right after its release, but since I started checking sale information, it hasn't gone on sale even once.

Once I have 1, I'll complete the smartphone version of the Dragon Quest numbering series! I bought the entire smartphone version of the Final Fantasy numbering series during last year's end-of-year sale.

I'm completely unfamiliar with Dragon Quest 6, not knowing the story or its reception at allâ€”is it considered a masterpiece within the Dragon Quest series? For now, I think I'll just purchase it and won't play it yet, but if I ever find a period where I can spare a lot of time, I would like to play it.
