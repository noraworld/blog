Late-night update as usual.

The long two-month spring break has come to an end, and classes started today. Since it was the first class, it ended around 2 PM. In the evening, I attended a meeting of the club I belong to, came home, took a bath, ate dinner, and it's now around 2 AM.

This time, I would like to write about the club I attended today and its members.

### App Club
The club I belong to is an app development club. It was established for creating web apps, iPhone apps, Android apps, etc. The only club I currently belong to is this app club.

This club was established just a year ago in April. I've been a member since its inception, so I've been part of this club for exactly one year.

My senior (now in 4th year) started the club, and at its peak, about 20 members gathered. There are three members, including myself, who are in the same grade as me (now 3rd year), and the rest are all underclassmen (now 2nd year).

The senior who founded the club got busy with research and stopped coming, and around that time, the other members of my grade also stopped attending, leaving me as the only upperclassman. Since the senior couldn't come, the club's leadership role was taken over by Toyu-kun, a junior. At that time, I wasn't very proactive, whereas Toyu-kun had been focusing on iPhone app development since last summer, so the senior entrusted him with the leadership.

After the summer break ended and the second semester began, attendance gradually dwindled, and today only six people attended the meeting.

### The decline in overall member motivation
Initially, we held study sessions and were actively engaged. However, since around the end of summer break, members' motivation has declined, and more people were unable to attend, or even if they participated, there was no progress. I'm speaking calmly from a third-person perspective, but in reality, I was one of them.

However, I personally developed an interest in creating a browser extension, and I started developing it around last winter. During the weekly progress reports, I presented my creations, but only Toyu-kun and I were making progress, and after the presentations, we would chat and then end, which continued for a long time.

### Dissolution of the club
We concluded that it would be challenging to continue the club when it was just a gathering for chatting, and thus decided to dissolve it. Today's meeting was to report this decision.

There had been discussions about disbanding for a while, but to consider the progress made by members during spring break, the discussion wasn't shared with everyone until today, when it became a formal topic.

Upon hearing this, members expressed that their passion for app development had waned, and no one opposed the dissolution. Personally, I had a fun year chatting with juniors, so it's a bit sad, but considering the lack of real activity in terms of app development, it can't be helped.

### Enthusiastic technical conversations
After three of the six members who participated today left, Toyu-kun, P-chan, and I, who remained by chance, had an engaging technical conversation.

P-chan is a junior who has been working part-time in web-related jobs since middle school and has exceptionally high technical skills. Due to this high skill level, P-chan is somewhat famous within the department. Although incomparable to me, P-chan is a promising individual for the future, and since we were in the same app club, I often had chances to talk. In that sense, it was a good decision to join this club, haha.

Toyu-kun has been developing iPhone apps since last summer and has better development skills than I do, so talking to these two felt informative and educational. Having conversations about technically interesting topics is quite enjoyable.

We talked about blogs, language specifications, servers, security, and so much more that I can't fully summarize here.

What surprised me during the conversation was that P-chan and I thought exactly alike. As mentioned in [the first post of this blog](http://blog.noraworld.jp/start-blog), I don't feel like it's "my blog" when using a blog service, so I set up my blog on a personal server. I also have a strong preference for usernames and email address strings, and I agonize for days if the username or address I want is already taken.

The fact that I was pondering exactly the same things as P-chan, like being unable to unify usernames across different services because one's available here but not there, was frankly surprising. Others might think it's silly, and I thought I was the only one worrying about such things, so I felt a strong sense of kinship.

Since I've always respected P-chan, I felt happy to know we shared the same thoughts. Also, being praised (or so it seemed) for blog design by P-chan, who can design for the web, was genuinely pleasing.

### Future plans
With the dissolution of the app club, I am temporarily unaffiliated, but I've already decided to join another club. It's a computer club involved in app development, VR (Virtual Reality) research, and a variety of other activities.

During spring break, I participated in a study session hosted by this club and found it interesting. Even if the app club had continued, I had thought about joining this club as well, so with the dissolution of the app club, I decided to join.

The app club's representative, Toyu-kun, also plans to join this club. Due to various reasons, P-chan is not joining, but P-chan plans to attend study sessions when hosted by the club. I don't know about the other members, but some seem interested.

While there's a lingering thought that if a few members join a similar club, we might have been able to continue the app club, the computer club is more active in app development, so it's hard to say.

But in the computer club, it seems like you can do a lot more than just app development, so I'm looking forward to it. There's a meeting in that club tomorrow (today), so I think I'll start by attending.

Thank you for reading such a lengthy post. Lastly, I'll include links to Toyu-kun and P-chan. It might be a nuisance for them, but I'll include them anyway, so please bear with me, haha. Toyu-kun has released an iPhone app on the App Store, so if you have an iPhone, please download it! (He's trying hard to earn advertising revenue, so please support him, haha).
