I successfully moved up a grade this year and in just a bit, my junior year lectures will start. Although I can't register for classes until the lectures actually begin, I've gone ahead and created my schedule.

In addition to the regular course registration, there are courses that require a separate application, along with lottery courses. Both require applications from those interested in taking them, but there is a slight difference between the two. With separate applications, you're almost guaranteed to be registered if you apply. However, with lottery courses, if there are too many applicants, selections are made randomly and you might not get in. With both types, if your application is successful, you can't withdraw. You need to think carefully before applying.

### Credit Calculation - How Many More Credits? -
I've already earned a fair number of credits during my freshman and sophomore years. Now, I need 6 more general education credits, 31 credits in my major, and 2 to 4 credits from specialized subjects.

I have to take 31 credits from my major, and there are only 34 credits available in the major for juniors. So, I'm planning to take them all. Most courses offer 2 credits each, so I can't afford to fail any of my major courses. I'll do my best...!

I was quite conflicted about my general education courses. The reason is that most of the general education courses I want to take **clash with my major courses**. After picking out courses that seemed interesting, I ended up with 11 courses (22 credits), but **7 of those courses (14 credits)** overlap with my major courses (one overlaps with another general education course).

It was the same during my sophomore year. Especially because there were many required courses that couldn't be skipped, I missed out on many general education courses due to major requirement conflicts.

In my junior year, many major courses are not required, so I'm free to choose, but with the necessity to take 31 credits, I can't avoid them. Hence, I might have to give up some general education courses...

However, I still need 6 more general education credits and plan to take 4 non-conflicting courses (8 credits), so as long as I don't fail, I should be fine. (As long as I don't fail...) I've failed 2 credits each in the first and second year, so even if I fail 2 this year, I should still have just enough to meet the requirement.

I forgot to mention, but as a junior, I still have a chance to earn credits in my senior year. However, I've heard that senior year gets busy with graduation research, so I hope to complete all my graduation credit requirements during my junior year, leaving only the graduation research for my senior year.

### Scheduled Courses
I'm taking all the junior-year major courses. Required courses include experiments, graduation research (which starts in the second semester of junior year), programming, computer operations, language processing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, distributed systems, computer graphics, and more. I don't fully understand the content of some courses, but I'm planning to take them all and earn the credits.

For general education courses, I'm taking psychology, law, economics, and business & society. I've wanted to take psychology for a while but never could because of schedule conflicts.

I thought I wasn't interested in law, but after looking at the syllabus, I found most of it revolves around copyright and portrait rights, so I decided to take it. Copyright knowledge is essential in the tech world.

I'm taking economics because there weren't other courses I was interested in. It's much better than taking sports, liberal arts seminars, religions, history, philosophy, or international studies. The same goes for business & society. They seem more practical than religion or philosophy, and, of course, getting the credits is my primary aim.

Besides the necessary credits, there are subjects I'm personally interested in, such as discrete mathematics and IT Practice 3. Discrete mathematics is part of the mathematical categories. I've already earned enough credits for them, but it seems interesting, so I'll take it. And yes, I plan to earn the credits.

IT Practice 3 is a special class for advanced IT exams. It's classified under career development and doesn't count towards credit requirements like other subjects, but since I want that qualification, I'm planning to take it. IT Practice 1 and 2 were second-year courses and they were prep courses for basic IT exams. I took both, so now I'm taking 3 to get that advanced IT qualification and some credits along the way.

### Lottery is a Game of Luck
Actually, out of the general education courses I mentioned earlier, economics and business & society are lottery-based. I just applied for them before writing this blog. But applying doesn't guarantee registration. If my application doesn't go through, I won't have enough general education credits and will have to reconsider my schedule. However, Iâ€™ve applied for lottery courses before and have never been rejected yet, so I'm planning my schedule assuming I'll get in.

If I don't get in, it will be unfortunate as there would be 8-9 courses I'd like to take but can't. I might then have to take general education courses in my senior year. I really hope to earn those 6 credits this year!
