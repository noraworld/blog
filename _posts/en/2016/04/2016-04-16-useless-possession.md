This time, I'll introduce some things I bought but haven't quite mastered using.

### iPad

It's an iPad Air 2. I bought this iPad last October. The reason I bought it was that I wanted to play games on a large screen. As you can see in the photo, I'm a big fan of Final Fantasy (especially FF) and Dragon Quest, and since both of these series are well-represented on iOS, I thought it would be great to play them on a large, impressive screen.

It's a bit of a niche topic, but isn't it amazing to have this much available on one platform!?

Of course, FF and Dragon Quest are released every few years, and each has different hardware. It's quite moving that you can play them as remakes on just one smartphone or tablet. Although not all series are covered, most of them are available.

Before buying the iPad, I was playing on an iPhone 5s. But on a smartphone, the screen is too small to be impressive. As someone who used to play on a TV, it didn't quite feel right. I wanted to play on a more impactful large screen, so I decided to buy an iPad.

By the way, when it comes to playing games like FF or Dragon Quest on a smartphone, people often talk about the controls, but I didn't have any problems because I bought an iOS-compatible game controller. Before I bought the controller, I was indeed struggling with the controls. I managed to get by with the first FF and games like FF4, Dragon Quest 5, and Dragon Quest 8, but FF7 and FF9 were quite challenging without it.

I bought the iPad primarily for gaming, but since around last December, I started developing Chrome extensions and got deeply immersed in programming, so I stopped playing games altogether. As a result, I stopped using the iPad, and it was left untouched for months.

### Things to Do on iPad
Today, I opened my iPad for the first time in a while and suddenly wondered. What exactly should I do with the iPad?

The great thing about tablets is their large screens. Because the screens are big, they're suitable for gaming, watching YouTube, and drawing.

However, in my case, I hardly play games anymore, and I don't draw. I do watch YouTube every day, but since I boot up my computer, I don't bother watching it on the iPad. I also like to browse while watching YouTube, so multitasking on a tablet is a bit inconvenient.

...So, I have no opportunities to use my iPad. For people who play games, draw, or want to watch YouTube on a large screen without booting up a computer, the iPad is a great device, but it just doesn't fit my style. That's why the iPad is something I haven't quite mastered using.

### Another Reason
...Now that I think about it, I remember another reason why I bought the iPad besides wanting to play games on a large screen. It was because of **storage issues**.

The iPhone 5s, which I still use actively, has only 16GB of storage. 16GB is already limited, and when you install large apps like FF and Dragon Quest, it quickly runs out of space.

I have the first FF, FF2, FF3, FF4, FF4 The After, FF5, FF6, FF7, FF9, and Dragon Quest 2, Dragon Quest 3, Dragon Quest 4, Dragon Quest 5, Dragon Quest 7, Dragon Quest 8, and with mobile games like FFRK and Hoshi Dragon, it easily goes over **20GB**. There's no way I could fit all that on an iPhone 5s, so part of the reason for buying an iPad was to solve that problem. That's why the iPad Air 2 has **128GB** of storage.

### Mobile Battery

This is the Cheero Power Plus 3 DANBOARD version. It has a capacity of 13,400mAh, so it's quite large. I bought it because it looks cute and (probably) because it was on sale during a release event. I didn't particularly want a mobile battery; I just thought I'd use it if I had one. But, as you might guess, I haven't mastered using it.

The reason I couldn't make the most of it is that I usually carry a computer (Mac) with me.

If I have a computer, I can charge my smartphone via USB, so I don't really need a mobile battery. And I can charge the laptop itself at the library from a power outlet, so there's no problem.

For people who don't carry a laptop every day and instead carry a mobile battery for charging, this is lightweight, can charge multiple times, and is convenient.

Since I go to university with my laptop almost every day, I can always charge my devices. That's why I haven't mastered using the mobile battery.

### Might Use It in the Future?
Although I haven't used it even once, it doesn't mean I won't ever use it. There might be times like during a class when I don't use my computer, but I want to charge my smartphone.

Also, my beloved Mac, which I use daily, has a battery that's showing signs of wear. It lasts a full day, so there's no major problem, but recently, while charging my smartphone, the Mac's battery depletes at an alarming rate.

Of course, the battery drains faster because I'm charging the smartphone, but it wasn't as noticeable before. Recently, though, I've started to notice it more.

When I'm working in the library and my laptop's battery is running low, I can charge it, but it's problematic when I want to use my computer during class. There are no power outlets in the classroom. And just a side note, charging smartphones directly in the library is prohibited. You can only charge them through the computer.

So, when I'm at school and don't want to use my computer but want to charge my smartphone or preserve my laptop's battery, I'll consider bringing the mobile battery along.

### Demand for Tablets
Back to the iPad, I feel like the demand for tablets is somewhat limited. For people who carry a computer every day, there's not much use for a tablet, I think (though, of course, there are some who use tablets extensively).

With a smartphone and a computer, you can handle minor searches or app usage on your smartphone, and perform more serious tasks on your computer, so there's no room for tablets, which sit in that in-between space.

Even though you can now connect a keyboard to a tablet and type or create presentations in PowerPoint, you can't do programming on them, right? Also, for efficiently working by switching between multiple applications, a computer is definitely more convenient.

I'm not dissing tablets, haha. I was thrilled when I first got my iPad, and even now, looking at a large Retina display screen excites me. But I just couldn't find a way to make good use of it.

For those of you who actively use tablets, I'd love to know how you use them. Since I spent 80,000 yen from my part-time job salary, leaving it as just a slab is such a waste!

Do you have things you haven't quite mastered using? Feel free to share!
