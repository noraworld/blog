The temperature is gradually rising, and it's becoming quite humid. I go to school in the morning for classes and work until around 9:00 PM. Since it's hot during the day and relatively cool at night, adjusting my body temperature is quite a challenge. As it's going to get even hotter, I plan to stay hydrated.

Now, I secretly implemented a comment system on this blog yesterday. I'm using a comment service called <a href="https://disqus.com" target="_blank">Disqus</a>.

### No Comment System
This blog uses a platform called <a href="https://ghost.org" target="_blank">Ghost</a>. I like it because both its design and functionality are very simple and stylish, but compared to other blogging systems like <a href="https://ja.wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, it has fewer features.

One of those missing features is a commenting function. I just assumed not everyone needs comments, so they aren't included by default.

### Why I Introduced a Comment System
I knew there was no comment feature, and I thought it wasn't necessary when I started this blog. Most of the people who read this blog are likely my seniors, juniors, and friends (from whom I can get feedback face-to-face or via Twitter), so I wasn't thinking about implementing a comment feature for a while.

However, I felt it would be even better if I could receive comments directly on this blog, so I decided to implement it.

Of course, if it's someone I know, direct conversation or Twitter is fine. But if in the future people I don't know see this blog or I introduce it to high school friends who don't use Twitter, it might be more convenient to have.

From my perspective, if I visit someone's blog and find a really interesting article, if there's an option to comment, I might be inclined to leave a simple "It was interesting" comment. However, if I have to use Twitter or email instead, I often end up deciding not to bother.

So, I hope that by enabling comments, it might encourage more interaction when others visit this blog in the future.

### Why Disqus?
The reason is very simple: it's popular.

I've seen various blogs—blogs by celebrities, technical blogs, stylish blogs by stylish people, blogs introducing food, and so on—and Disqus was used in many of them.

Blog services like Ameba, Liveboor, and Hatena Blog have their own comment systems, but Disqus was very common in blogs created with WordPress or other original blog engines. In fact, I haven't seen any external commenting services besides Disqus.

It's famous, everyone uses it, and it's stylish, so I chose to use it too.

### How to Comment
The comment section is at the very bottom of the article.

Just write your comment in the form and press the button. However, to comment, you'll need an account with either Disqus, Facebook, Twitter, or Google.

When I implemented Disqus on this blog, I found it very easy to get started, and creating an account only took a few seconds. Simplicity is definitely a plus.

### Rough Summary
The reason for incorporating the comment feature was not envisioning that many people will view it in the future. Of course, I’d be happy if many people read my blog, but since I write what I want purely for personal reasons, I expect only acquaintances or a few people to stumble upon it through searches.

When someone who visits by chance becomes a repeater and visits a few times, I'd be delighted if they leave a comment. Also, even if it's from someone I know, hearing "I haven't touched on it, but I'm secretly checking it out" can make me quite happy.

I know I'm having trouble expressing myself and repeating things over and over, but basically, I want to know what people who read this blog think and make this space more open.

Even if the conclusion seems somewhat messy, I hope you continue to enjoy this blog.
