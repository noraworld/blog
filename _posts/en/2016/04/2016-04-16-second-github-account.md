I just created a second GitHub account, so I'm making it public now. I will be using this as a sub-account.

* Sub-account → <a href="https://github.com/secondnoraworld" target="_blank">secondnoraworld</a>
* Main account is here → <a href="https://github.com/noraworld" target="_blank">noraworld</a>

[Correction: 2016/04/22 (Fri)]

I turned it into an organization instead of an account. Since the account has been deleted, the sub-account in this article is now an organization. The newly created organization has the same URL as the old second account, so no link changes are needed. The reason for the change to an organization is summarized in the article [Changed Second GitHub Account to an Organization](http://blog.noraworld.jp/github-account-to-organization/). Thank you for your continued support.

### Why I Started Using GitHub
As many of you may know, GitHub is a service for publishing source code managed with Git on the web. You can choose to make your repositories publicly or privately accessible, and public ones can be used for free by anyone.

Not only individuals but also companies like Apple and Google release source code as open source, and I have the impression that all the great engineers in the world use it.

In my surroundings, there are people who create web apps, websites, or iPhone apps, and all those people use GitHub.

This spring break, I was doing a web-related part-time job, and a student from another university working with me had a very high level of technical skills. During a conversation at a social gathering, that person advised me, "If you want to improve your technical skills, just publish your code on GitHub and have lots of people review it!"

I had known about GitHub and even had an account, but since I could share files via Dropbox while working alone, I thought that was enough... But I heard that you need version control system knowledge when working with a few people and that it's required in companies as well. Moreover, I was told that if I publish my code, it could showcase what I've done, so I decided to start using GitHub seriously with this opportunity.

### Reason for Creating a Sub-Account
I decided to publish any code I write, no matter how trivial the project might seem. For example, the code I wrote during study sessions would often get deleted or misplaced, so I thought of utilizing GitHub to retrospectively view what I created long ago.

However, I was hesitant to take the step. The reason was **I didn't want my original repositories to get mixed up**. The projects created during study sessions were made strictly following slides and were not something I came up with on my own.

I wanted to keep both the things I created myself and the ones I created during study sessions as proof of what I learned through programming, but I didn't want them to get mixed up... So, I decided to publish what I made in study sessions on the sub-account.

### How to Differentiate Between the Two Accounts
So, I’d like to clarify how to differentiate between the two accounts here. If not clearly defined, they would end up getting mixed up.

#### Main Account

1. Things I intend to publish on my site or release in a store
2. Something I want to showcase as my work

Whatever I'd like to thoroughly develop will be managed on the main account. The main account already has code for Chrome extensions I released in the Chrome Web Store and extensions I'm considering releasing in the future.

#### Sub-Account

1. Things created in study sessions
2. Class exercise assignments
3. Things made casually for study purposes but want to keep nonetheless

I'll publish code that I want to keep as something I’ve created, even though it's not the main focus. I have just published the code created in the [JS / jQuery Event Seminar](http://blog.noraworld.jp/js-jquery-seminar-at-kyoto) I attended last week.

Also, I am taking Java exercise classes at the university. There was an explanation about managing source code with Git in the exercise materials, so I intend to actively publish such work as well.

### Be Proactive in Publishing
I've mentioned this before, but as a self-reminder, I'll say it again. I intend to be more active in publishing my source code.

When making something alone, it tends to get lazy or covered up with makeshift coding in cumbersome parts, but once you decide to publish the source code, you can't afford to create sloppy code. By pushing myself this way, I hope to stir up the motivation to develop something I wanted to but never got around to and feel encouraged to create more diverse stuff to showcase to many more people!

However, because sloppy coding is not an option, I might end up overthinking variable or function names or coding styles, inadvertently putting a damper on free coding.

Thus, I’ll strive to find a moderate balance where I maintain solid coding without getting bogged down in details, which might otherwise hamper motivation.

### Promotion
Since I mentioned I released a Chrome extension on the Chrome Web Store and published the source code, let me take this opportunity to promote that extension.

In early February this year, I released a Google Chrome extension in the Chrome Web Store. It's an extension called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/%E3%83%8B%E3%82%B3%E3%83%8B%E3%82%B3%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC/baiinihbicmkmkhblpboabkckgheaahm?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon" target="_blank">Nico Nico Commander</a>.

I often watch Nico Nico Douga, but unlike YouTube, it lacks shortcut keys. On YouTube, for example, pressing J rewinds 10 seconds, K toggles play/pause, and L skips forward 10 seconds.

Since I often use shortcut keys, I thought it would be nice to have similar shortcuts for Nico Nico Douga, so I created Nico Nico Commander.

A detailed explanation is available on the download page. After installation, checking the settings page should let you know all the available shortcut keys.

Nico Nico Commander is (of course) free to download. Unlike iPhone apps, there are no ads, so no matter how much it gets downloaded, I don't earn money, but I'll be delighted if it gets many downloads, so if you are interested, please check it out!
