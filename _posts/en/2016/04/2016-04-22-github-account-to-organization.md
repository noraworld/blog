Lately, I've been feeling unmotivated, likely because of the "May disease." It's tough to have things I want to do but lack the motivation to start. This happens to me around this time every year. I hope to recover soon and get back to working hard...!

### Learned About the Organization Feature
A short while ago, I updated an article like this.

[Created a Second GitHub Account](http://blog.noraworld.jp/second-github-account/)

After updating this article, I received a reply on Twitter from my junior, P-chan.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="ja"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/nora20120808">@nora20120808</a> Wouldn't it be better to use an Organization? Isn't switching accounts a hassle?</p>&mdash; P-chan (@p1ch_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/p1ch_jp/status/721632103469723648">April 17, 2016</a></blockquote>

To reiterate, I created a second GitHub account to manage personal projects I want to develop thoroughly separately from lighter source codes created during study sessions or classes.

However, having two accounts means I need to switch accounts every time I create a new repository. Until creating the accounts, I hadn't known about the Organization feature in GitHub.

Initially, I didn't find switching between two accounts particularly burdensome because I intended to manage both accounts properly. But after P-chan informed me about the Organization feature, I was torn between continuing with the accounts or switching to an Organization. (This kind of indecision that makes me feel bad is a terrible habit of mine...)

Incidentally, **accounts and organizations share the same URL format**, so if there is already an account named secondnoraworld, **you cannot create an organization with the same name**. Thus, if creating an organization with the same name, you need to delete the account first and then create the organization. In any case, I planned to delete the account once the organization was created since it would no longer be necessary.

### What is an Organization?
Simply put, it is a group intended for collaborative development by multiple people. Members of the organization share source codes.

P-chan informed me that instead of creating a second account, I could use an organization where **only I am a member**, effectively using it as a second account.

By doing this, I can manage repositories on separate pages with a single account, eliminating the need to switch accounts.

### Managing Multiple Accounts
I don't like having multiple accounts for the same service. This is because switching between them is cumbersome, and I believe it **divides my identity**.

Switching is troublesome because it's challenging to store multiple IDs and passwords in a browser. If there's only one account for a service, it can automatically fill in the ID and password during login, but with multiple stored accounts, you need to at least input the ID. Furthermore, with just one account, there's no need to log out, making it convenient.

The idea of dividing my identity might be a strange notion only I hold. I'm somewhat aware of it myself.

For example, in the context of Twitter, I believe there should only be one of me in the Twitter world. Having multiple accounts means there are multiple versions of me within that space. I don't like this division of identity. It doesn't bother me with others, but I personally dislike having multiple accounts.

For me, the latter reason holds more weight.

### After Much Consideration
Sorry to digress, but I generally don't like having multiple accounts. However, in this case, since I have a clear reason to manage two accounts, I created them without much hesitation.

But learning about the Organization feature made me really ponder. If I opted for an organization, the main would be an account and the sub an organization—an unbalanced relationship. However, without identity division and the ability to reach links from both the account and organization, negating the need to list two links in introductions, I judged that it'd be better, so I switched to an organization.

### My Complicated Nature
Only an organization switch, yet I deliberated excessively—that's just how complicated I am. I'm aware of it, but can't seem to change this mindset. In [Circle Dissolution and Last Meeting](http://blog.noraworld.jp/circle-breakup/), I similarly focused heavily on account names.

Moreover, being someone with this kind of complicated way of thinking makes me a minority, which is a bit sad since few may relate... Especially about identity division—probably nobody but me thinks that way (If there is, let me know; it'd make me really happy!).

I will likely continue to reveal my strange thoughts in future articles, so I'd be grateful if you take a look when you have time.

### No Change in URL
Since I remade an organization with the same name as the second account, the URL remains the same as introduced in [Created a Second GitHub Account](http://blog.noraworld.jp/second-github-account/), <a href="https://github.com/secondnoraworld" target="_blank">secondnoraworld</a>. However, it's now an organization, not an account.

Incidentally, my main account is <a href="https://github.com/noraworld" target="_blank">noraworld</a>. Thank you for your continued support.
