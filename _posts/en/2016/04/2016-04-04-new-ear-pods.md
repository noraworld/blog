The Ear Pods I ordered the day before yesterday arrived today.

### Ear Pods

When you hear "Ear Pods," you might be wondering, "What is that?" but I bet you've seen them at least once. Many iPhone users probably use them. These are the Apple genuine earphones that come with an iPhone purchase.

The first Apple product I used was an iPod touch (5th generation). I bought it about 3-4 years ago. Since I started using the Ear Pods that came with the iPod touch, I've been using these earphones ever since.

Right after entering university, I bought an iPhone 5s and got my second pair of Ear Pods. By the way, the Ear Pods that come with the iPod touch and those that come with the iPhone differ. The Ear Pods that come with the iPhone are the same as the ones in the photo, with volume buttons in the middle of the cord. In contrast, the Ear Pods that came with the iPod touch do not have these. Therefore, you need to be careful when buying Ear Pods separately.

Moreover, these volume buttons not only allow you to adjust the volume but also have various functions such as playing the previous/next track, fast forward, rewind, and launching Siri. However, note that these operations can only be performed on **Apple products like iPhone and Mac**.

Back to the point, I actually have three Ear Pods, with the third one being given to me by a parent's friend who didn’t need it. That one is the type without the volume buttons that came with the iPod touch.

### Reason for Purchase
Why buy another one when you already have three? Before I explain that, let me tell you why I want multiple earphones.

I use earphones quite frequently, so I need to have them on hand at home and when going out. When using them outside, I can just take them with me, but if I use the same ones as at home, I tend to forget them in my backpack. Also, when using them at home, I always want to have a pair permanently attached to the computer I use daily, and I want a different pair for connecting to my iPhone, iPad, or 3DS. It's cumbersome to connect and disconnect.

In short, it's about avoiding hassle. I need at least three pairs: one to keep always in my backpack for outings, one to leave plugged into my daily-use computer, and the last one to use with my iPhone or 3DS.

Thus, I already have the necessary three pairs, but the Ear Pods I used with my computer were the ones that came with my iPod touch, so I've been using them for 3-4 years continuously. When used for so long, the seam where the headphones go into your ears tends to widen, making it hard to hear.

For me, especially on the left ear side, the seam opened up, and the sound became quieter. As I frequently watch YouTube and Niconico videos and listen to music daily, I was worried I might have developed hearing loss in my left ear. However, using the earphones meant for outings, both ears sounded normally balanced, leading me to realize that the computer earphones were at the end of their life.

### Ordered from Apple's Website
I've been wanting three pairs for a while, and I received the third pair from my parent's friend this January. In fact, before receiving that, I once bought a pair myself.

However, the sound quality of that pair was not good. Although I don't have a great ear or absolute pitch, even I could notice something was wrong with the sound. I considered returning them, but too many days had passed since the purchase, and since I hadn't bought them from Apple, I might have bought a budget version.

The reason I didn't buy from Apple's site was the price. Buying from Apple's site is expensive. The Ear Pods I bought this time were 3,500 yen (excluding tax). But the ones I bought then were about 1,000 yen (excluding tax). If they were really a budget version, it might mean they were sold at an attractively cheap price but with poor sound quality while looking the same as genuine ones.

After realizing the sound quality issue, I stopped using those Ear Pods, and eventually, they got lost somewhere. I don't recall throwing them away, so they should be somewhere, but I couldn't find them no matter how hard I searched.

Given that background, I decided to buy original ones this time and ordered from Apple's site. It's a bit expensive, but shipping is free, and they arrive quickly after ordering, so I'm satisfied aside from the price.

### Recommendation
If you are going to buy Ear Pods, I personally recommend ordering from Apple's site. There’s a possibility of pulling a poor-quality item like I did. However, since the price is high, if you don't mind as long as they play sound and want something cheap, buying from places like Amazon is an option. Just be sure to check the reviews, and if the evaluation is significantly bad, it's better not to buy.

Also, if you're buying from somewhere like Amazon, confirm whether they are the ones that come with the iPod touch or iPhone! As mentioned, the volume buttons don't work on non-Apple products. When I checked on Amazon, the Ear Pods that come with the iPod touch without volume buttons were about 1,000 yen cheaper, so if you don't plan to use them with Apple products or don't need volume buttons, I recommend buying the iPod touch ones.

The one I bought this time is for a computer (which is not an Apple product), so the volume buttons don't work, but Apple’s website didn't sell the type without volume buttons, so I bought this one. It might just have been unavailable when I bought it, so you might want to check which type it is when purchasing from Apple's site.
