Today, I participated in a secret event for aspiring engineers and I would like to share the experience with you! I might be a bit tipsy, so apologies if the text is difficult to read, but I hope you'll stay with me until the end.

### What is the Secret Event?
The Secret Event is an engineer-oriented event hosted by [Supporterz](https://supporterz.jp) and was held on 7/3 (Sunday). I had individual interviews with 11 companies primarily involved in web and mobile app businesses, and had the opportunity to personally appeal myself while listening to some valuable talks that are rarely available.

Here are the companies that participated (titles omitted):

* Akatsuki
* KLab
* Colopl
* CyberAgent
* Cybozu
* SHIFT
* DeNa
* Fringe81
* VOYAGE GROUP
* Rakuten
* Leverages

### Event Flow
The event started at 10 a.m. with approximately 30 minutes of guidance and presentation preparation, followed by each company's presentation lasting about 5 minutes until lunchtime.

After taking a lunch break, individual interviews started in the afternoon. Each company's interview lasted around 30 minutes, with the first 5 minutes dedicated to self-introduction and self-promotion. I used a presentation slide prepared in advance to present myself. For the remaining 25 minutes, I answered questions from the companies and listened to their explanations and internship information.

The individual interviews were held with 9 companies for about 30 minutes each, followed by a networking party that lasted about an hour starting around 6:30 p.m.

### What I Got from the Event
I received materials from each company at the event, as well as stickers and plush toys (?).

A mysterious box received from Colopl. Peeking inside...

It contained something like a picture book. I can't show the inside, but it includes photos of engineers working at the company and catchphrases exploring "What is entertainment?"

The paper quality is excellent and it felt like looking at a piece of art with a high level of completion. Colopl is quite generous in giving so much!

Moreover, I even received a bear plush toy before my interview with Colopl! Adorable!!

![Energy Drink](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/secret-event-2016/energy_drink.jpg)

As I had interviews with 9 companies, it was pretty long. I received an energy drink from Supporterz midway. It tasted the same as I remember.

### Networking Party
After the long interviews with 9 companies, there was a networking party where students and companies gathered together. We had a casual conversation while eating pizza and drinking alcohol.

It was curry flavored. A unique pizza with cheese even in the crust.

### Companies I Found Interesting
I originally had an interest in web-based companies, and plan to participate in web-centered internships. Most of the companies at this event leaned towards mobile apps, so there seemed to be fewer web-centered businesses.

However, there were several intriguing web-centered companies I'd like to introduce.

#### CyberAgent
A well-known company famous for Ameba. In the web business, there's Ameba Blog and Ameba Pigg, and in mobile apps, for instance, Girl Friend BETA. Also, the recently popular AbemaTV. I've introduced it in this blog before, and I think it’s a quite interesting service. I almost watch it daily, sparking my interest.

Additionally, CyberAgent is reputed to be a company friendly to engineers, allowing them to work relatively freely under a discretionary labor system. An engineer working there mentioned that they spare no expense in investing in engineers.

#### Cybozu
This is a company that primarily operates on the web. They create a service called kintone, which further evolves Google Forms. In internships, you can participate in developments that add new features to kintone.

I didn't know about kintone initially, but after watching an introductory video, it seems to be a very user-friendly and convenient service. Unlike Google Forms, it allows detailed settings for form width and layout, making it possible to create forms suited to various purposes. Moreover, it's very simple to use with just drag and drop operations.

Since you can add your own JavaScript, it’s possible to embed, for instance, Google Maps into forms. Additionally, you can freely customize with CSS, making it usable for a wide range of purposes.

It seemed pretty useful and being able to engage in front-end development for this in an internship looked appealing.

#### Rakuten
Rakuten has the image of being a company that requires super engineers who are fluent in English, have a TOEIC score of over 800, and can manage, making the internships seemingly quite challenging.

However, the person from Rakuten who attended today works mainly in Osaka and emphasized proactive attitudes over technical skills, implying that not having technical skills now wouldn’t be a barrier to recruitment. Hearing this, I thought about participating in their internship.

#### Leverages
Initially, I didn’t know this company’s name, but hearing they run a Japanese site for programming questions, teratail, suddenly made them feel relatable.

Focusing their business on the web, they appear to develop without adhering to specific programming languages. The Yukunuri Hackathon (an internship where you can code and develop while leisurely enjoying hot springs) looked quite interesting. Thank you for following on Twitter.

#### Others
Other interesting companies included Fringe81, which delves deeply into the nuances of programming languages, and VOYAGE GROUP, developing MangaPededia, a site for detailed manga information, as well as Colopl, developing new gaming experiences by combining gaming with VR, who were also quite generous with goods.

### Disappointed... And Then?
Out of the 11 companies that attended, I had individual interviews with 9. Therefore, it was not possible to have interviews with 2 companies.

I was most interested in CyberAgent, but they happened to be one of the two companies I couldn’t interview with...! (The other company was Akatsuki.)

Having an interest in the web field, and the fact that the HR person from CyberAgent who attended a previous internship event at my university was also present at today’s event made me hopeful for a more intimate interview, but not having an interview was quite disappointing...

This decision wasn't made by CyberAgent, but rather by Supporterz in the end, so there wasn’t much that could be done, but I personally wish they’d have considered my interest in the web field more.

However, at the networking party, I was able to talk to a new employee (?) and intern from CyberAgent, which was nice.

The HR person I had previously met had already left the venue by the time of the networking party. However, I heard a very intriguing piece of information from an intern: the HR person I had previously met was interested in me and said something about not being able to have an interview with me.

We couldn’t have a conversation about it at this event, but I was very pleased to learn they remembered me and were interested in me (?). Since CyberAgent is the company I was most interested in, there’s nothing more delightful. So, I certainly plan to apply for their internship this summer!

### Summer Internship
At the very least, I plan to apply to CyberAgent. While many other companies also catch my interest, Rakuten has long-term engagements, and others are mostly short-term with overlapping schedules, so I will have to consider schedules while applying for internships.

### Impressions
Participating in an event like this for the first time was a valuable experience. It seemed unique to this event to encounter companies I became interested in that I didn’t know before, or companies I knew but realized they were different from my image.

Moving forward, as applications for summer internships start, I think I’ll proactively participate in similar events if there are any!

### Bonus
I bought Yatsuhashi at Kyoto Station on my way back. It was delicious!
