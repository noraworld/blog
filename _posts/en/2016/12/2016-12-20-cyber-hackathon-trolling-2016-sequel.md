The article I published recently, "[Summary of the Cybercrime Prevention Hackathon and Controversy](https://noraworld.blog/cyber-hackathon-trolling-2016/)" was widely shared across various platforms and read by a large number of people.

When you search for queries like "Cybercrime Prevention Hackathon" or "Cyber Hackathon," it shows up on the first page.

I posted the article above around 2 AM on December 19 (Monday), and when I checked around 1 AM on December 20 (Tuesday), it was already at the top of Google's page rank.

At one point, it was also listed as a hot entry in the technology section of Hatena Bookmarks.

### The Trigger
As those who've seen that article (linked above) already know, it was quite a controversial topic—perhaps you could say it went viral.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="ja"><p lang="ja" dir="ltr">Summary of the Cybercrime Prevention Hackathon and Controversy <a href="https://t.co/97nKvcCNF4">https://t.co/97nKvcCNF4</a><br><br>I tweeted a bit late, so I'll do it again tomorrow!<br><br>Going viral is scary (not my problem)</p>&mdash; のら (@noraworld_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/noraworld_jp/status/810526204532903936">December 18, 2016</a></blockquote>

This was what I tweeted about the article. It's ironic that my blog went viral over a blog post about a hackathon I participated in that also went viral.

Putting jokes aside, this time, I'd like to clarify some mistakenly published information regarding this article, my personal thoughts and suggestions on how things might have avoided going so viral, and also some clarifications and reflections on the misunderstandings my statements might have caused. For convenience, I will refer to the article linked above as the "viral article."

**This article is a follow-up to the viral article. Please read the viral article first before returning to this one.**

### Misunderstandings
Firstly, in the viral article, I had a significant misunderstanding. Since the hackathon was conducted in collaboration with RCC and the Kyoto Prefectural Police, I assumed the judges were mainly from the Kyoto Prefectural Police (with only a few teachers and engineers included).

However, reading the comments on the viral article revealed that the panel consisted of "7 engineers, 4 teachers, and 1 police officer." So my statement that the "judges were people who didn't understand technology" was completely wrong. I apologize for this mistake.

Nevertheless, the core message I wanted to convey in the viral article remains largely unchanged. Even if more than half of the judges were technically skilled engineers, I personally believe the controversy over the hackathon would have occurred anyway.

So please do not misunderstand that I wrote the article out of anger because I incorrectly assumed the panel had no technical knowledge and blamed my team's lack of recognition on their lack of technical skills.

### The Cause of the Hackathon Controversy
The primary cause of the hackathon controversy, I believe, lies in the misalignment of evaluative criteria between the participants and the judges.

My team, along with TomoriNao's team and Imori's team—the three main teams—developed from a technical standpoint to prevent cybercrime, while the panel seemed to value teams that created apps for the enlightenment and awareness of security threats.

Some might argue that we failed to grasp the essence of evaluation based on "the contribution by high school students" or "dissemination to the public," but regardless, the ambiguity in explanations and expressions led to discrepancies in judging criteria between participants and judges. Otherwise, all those who reacted (people on Twitter mentioned in the viral article) wouldn't have made such a fuss.

Therefore, I believe the hackathon (from the judges' side) should have clarified whether the evaluation was based on "technical prevention" or "awareness prevention," or possibly both, to avoid the controversy.

Furthermore, if the hackathon was based on evaluating "awareness" and the technical presentations received low ratings because they couldn't grasp the practical usefulness, as previously mentioned, that's worrying.

The participating engineers and teachers on the judging panel are likely to have significant knowledge in technology and, presumably, security. However, as far as I know, not many specialized in security.

If the companies participating as judges were the ones who gave presentations at the ideathon about a month ago, probably two of them were gaming (related) companies. Taking this into account, it almost feels natural that teams related to games would win or be runners-up.

Regarding this, I have no intention of complaining. The teams that developed the awarded games also aimed to educate many people about cybersecurity, aligning with the theme of preventing cybercrime. However, the fact that technical security presentations were mostly unvalued in a hackathon named "Cybercrime Prevention" leaves me wondering. Just looking at the name, it feels like the impression of a security-focused hackathon is stronger.

Let me emphasize that the above is just a personal opinion and not intended to criticize any companies or teachers. This hackathon relies on the support of the participating companies and teachers (and of course, RCC's organizing team), and I am grateful for their cooperation. This is simply a personal viewpoint on the mismatch between the hackathon and my expectations.

Also, I'm not saying the judging panel didn't understand the technical prevention developed by the teams (mainly TomoriNao's team). Instead, my thought is if there were hardly any experts in security present at a security-focused presentation, what does that say about a security-themed hackathon?

### Conclusion
Reflecting calmly upon the viral article and the reasons for the controversy, the fatigue from lack of sleep after the hackathon might have translated into the text, resulting in somewhat aggressive expressions and causing discomfort for some involved (like members of the Kyoto Prefectural Police and engineers who participated). Additionally, the parts I misunderstood were probably exaggerated.

From the Kyoto Prefectural Police or companies' perspective, I understand they might feel, "after all the planning and organization, what is this attitude!" Certainly, seeing remarks like "I was dissatisfied" after putting in so much effort to prepare understandably generates discomfort. I apologize for that.

However, my intention was not to upset anyone but to convey that many people (those quoted on Twitter) had these dissatisfaction points with the hackathon to inform even those who weren't involved. Initially, I assumed it would spur some thinking within the RCC members like, "I see, that's what happened with this hackathon," but it ended up being shared far and wide unexpectedly. Ultimately, the information even reached the professor at our lab, spreading significantly (I had no intention of making this public, but at this point, I’m somewhat resigned…w).

With that said, I've conveyed what I wanted (probably), so I’m not looking to escalate things further. Rather, the concern was unwanted spread due to strong reactions and misinformation, hence deciding to write this additional article.

Finally, there's a request. Getting criticized or my article going viral (it already has) is fine, but please refrain from making those uncomfortable comments on my team members or tweets that could unsettle them. Someone might suggest deleting the article, but I intend to express my opinions on this hackathon but don't want it to unjustly involve others or damage the reputation of my university and RCC.

Thank you for reading this till the end. If you read this before the viral article, please also check that one out.
