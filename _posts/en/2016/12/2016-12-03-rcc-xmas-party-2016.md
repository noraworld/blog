Today, I attended the RCC (a club) Christmas party. Since Christmas is on the 25th, this party was a bit early(?).

It was scheduled to start at noon, but the gathering was poor, so it actually started around 1 o'clock.

### Quiz Competition
First, we had a quiz competition, which was essentially the main event. It was a Googling proficiency contest(?), where we were divided into teams to Google and post answers to the questions given.

The questions covered a wide range of topics, from information technology and science to anime and general knowledge. Since we primarily relied on Googling for answers, many of the questions were quite difficult.

My team consisted of four members, including third- and fourth-year students. The quiz had four sections, with about eight questions per section, and we competed on points.

My team was Team ②. We had a strong senior in our team, so we won overwhelmingly 💪.

Although I wasn't able to contribute much, especially to the anime questions (and generally), it was enjoyable to collaborate and share answers through Google. I've always loved quiz competitions but rarely have the opportunity to participate, so I had a great time this time. Thank you to everyone who organized it 😊.

The winning team received prizes 🎁.

The prizes were a microcomputer and a PC cooler. After a round of rock-paper-scissors, I ended up with the PC cooler. Thank you!

### BINGO
After the quiz competition, we played BINGO. It was probably the first time in about ten years.

I struggled to even get a "reach," and even when I did, I kept hitting "reach" after "reach" until I finally got BINGO with around a triple reach. There were over 20 people at the Christmas party, but I was probably among the last to get BINGO 😂.

### Gift Exchange
We exchanged gifts we had prepared in advance. All the presents were gathered in one spot and we took turns picking them up. The order was determined by the BINGO results, allowing the first five people to freely choose their presents.

I had prepared snacks worth over 1,000 yen, but it was a poor choice since snacks and drinks were already available during the Christmas party 😅.

I received a plush pig 🐷.

The texture is really nice, so I plan to keep it at home and enjoy its fluffiness←.

Later, there was a segment where everyone introduced the gifts they received, and there were many unique and amusing presents.

The funniest one was this w

It suited them very well✨.

And with everyone's request, they wore it to the second party too!

Additionally, I gave Edamame-kun a packet of edamame as a gift.

### Second Party
After the gift exchange, I joined the second party.

At Torikizoku, it was all-you-can-eat and all-you-can-drink.

While the food here was generally good, there were several issues...

1. Even when pressing the call button repeatedly, no one comes.
2. Orders take a long time to arrive.
3. Orders were suddenly canceled due to a long grilling time.
4. Orders that hadn't come yet all arrived suddenly at the last minute.
5. Grilled dishes arrived after desserts.

The fourth point, "orders that hadn't arrived came all at once just before the end," was quite bad. If there was leftover food at the end, extra charges would apply, and it seemed like they targeted that by bringing a lot just before the end. However, the end time was extended, so it wasn't ultimately a problem.

The worst was when Utsuroki-kun ordered ochazuke, it didn't arrive, so he said, "if it's not ordered, one ochazuke please," and when it still didn't arrive, he mentioned it again, finally receiving three bowls of ochazuke at the very end.

Even if they were busy, I felt there was ill intent here. It seemed this was RCC's first visit to Torikizoku as a whole, and somehow, it seems that the next party won't be held there.

Despite the venue issues, the second party itself was quite enjoyable. Initially, I was at a non-drinking table, but the conversation didn't flow well, so I moved to the table with a group with whom I've chatted more often within RCC, and the conversation was so enjoyable that I ended up having a drink 🍹.

The technical chat (about domain stuff) was fun, as was watching the comedy acts of the slightly tipsy members w.

Before the Christmas party, I wasn't planning on going to the second party, but I'm glad I did. Also, thank you for adjusting the additional numbers 🙏.

### After the Second Party
After the second party, I felt I'd be engulfed by a sense of emptiness if I went straight home and wanted a bit more fun, so I considered going to a third party. However, seeing as the third party venue lacked internet access, which would've been inconvenient since I also wanted to update my blog, I decided to skip it and write this blog instead.

### Conclusion
Today's Christmas party was enjoyable all around. I was slightly disappointed not to play Smash Bros., but even without it, I had a fulfilling time. I'll probably attend next year – or rather, I want to.

### Twitter
The hashtag for this year's Christmas party was [#メリクリRCC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%E3%83%A1%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AARCC). It seems like someone came up with it. With this, you can see everyone's Christmas party experiences!

And to make good use of the opportunity, I'll leave my tweet here.

By the way, during the second party, the conversation turned to domains, and Utsuroki-kun asked, "Do you own nora.world?" I realized I didn't, so I went ahead and acquired it before writing this blog💪.
