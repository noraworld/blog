A friend invited me to a sauna.

However, I'm really resistant to being naked in front of others. It's one thing to be shirtless, but being completely nude feels like the peak of embarrassment. But he has invited me multiple times, and every time I decline, he seems disappointed. This likely means that there is something quite attractive about saunas.

I've never experienced it, and being prejudiced could narrow my life's scope and lead to loss. So, if repeated invitations like this come, perhaps it would be better for my life to accept and try it at least once. You often hear how experiencing something can change your worldview. Moreover, if it were someone I'm not too close with inviting me, it would be a different story. But since it's an invitation from a close friend, if I decline, I may never experience a sauna in my life, which would be quite a waste. Precisely because it's an invitation from a close friend, perhaps it's a chance to experience something I honestly don't want to do?

So this time, I decided to accept the invitation. As a result, I might discover something new, realize that I'm not actually as resistant to exposing my body in public as I thought, or confirm that I indeed dislike it. But all of that is part of the "experience." Without experience, I wouldn't even know if I truly dislike it. It's like Schr√∂dinger's cat. I might just be deluding myself in my imagination. Repeating such a life would surely lead to something insignificant. So this time, I decided to boldly step out of my comfort zone.
