It's exactly 11 PM on October 16. Just one hour to go until today ends. I haven't eaten anything today. Not since I woke up ‚Äî I mean, literally nothing since it turned midnight on October 16. So I'm hungry. Plus, I slept only three and a half hours last night, so I'm a bit tired. Still, before this day ends, I wanted to write something, so here I am at my computer.

Today is my birthday. I turned 30, which feels like an important milestone.

Today is also a special day because I started a new job, marking my departure from being a "neet" (not in education, employment, or training). Like last year, I struggled to hold onto a job this year too. But obviously, you can't live without working. I was barely managing with daily expenses while being behind on bills like local taxes, national health insurance, and national pension contributions. Financially, things were tough. Realizing it was getting critical, I seriously started looking for a job in September, and today, my birthday, October 16, I began working at a new place. I've already contacted the tax and pension offices to inform them of my situation and payment plans.

The tough situation isn't just about my job. I'm still paying off credit card dues from last year, and with student loans and money borrowed from my parents, my debt is close to 6 million yen. Even though the monthly repayments on student loans are small, the total repayment amount is substantial. Thinking about paying off such a large sum in the future is daunting.

If I were the type who finds fulfillment in working hard, maybe I could use this debt as motivation. But, unfortunately, I'm not that type. Last year and this year, I was constantly struggling to pay taxes and insurance and sometimes couldn't even cover living expenses, which left me feeling mentally drained.

I'll save more thoughts on this topic for articles like "Why I Struggle to Commit in a Capitalist Society" or "The Agony of Entering Adulthood with Massive Debt," but for now, I'll leave it at that since it's my birthday.

As I mentioned earlier, today is also the start of my new job. Since it was my first day, I went to the office. I received a job offer in mid-September, and after some adjustments, today became my first day. Even when October started, there were no clear talks on the contract, and the conditions were changing, making me anxious. But I'm glad I could begin working as scheduled.

Starting back at work on my birthday was half a coincidence, half intentional. Since I got the job offer in mid-September, it took time for things like finalizing conditions and preparing contracts, which pushed the start to mid-October. The contract was finally signed on October 15, just a day before. I was really worried about such a late start. So, I've been prompt in replying and handling procedures over the past few weeks.

The initial start date suggested by the agency was around October 14, which means starting this week. But I thought, why not make it on my birthday? It would be fun and give me something to chat about with friends. So I asked if starting on the 16th would be okay, and after the agency considered it, today became my start date.

There's a playful side to this decision, but I'm also sincere. I've struggled mentally and financially by not taking work seriously. I want to end this lifestyle and start living more stably. Birthdays can feel like a new beginning, similar to setting New Year resolutions.

Turning 30 is a significant milestone for me, so I'm glad I could start work on this day. Some people might want to relax on their birthdays, but for someone like me who has been lounging around, returning to a more stable life feels right. I'm grateful to the agency and company for accommodating my request üôè.

So today, I went to the office. The company operates from 10 AM whether you come in or not, so I aimed to arrive by then. It's been a while since I commuted during rush hour. Since COVID, I've mostly worked remotely, so I didn't expect to experience this again. Thankfully, the train wasn't too crowded, and the office isn't too far.

I'll mostly work remotely from now on, with office days about once a week. I can also avoid commuting during the rush by starting later, so it's not much stress. Being full remote made me lonely, even as a lone wolf type who enjoys solitude. Work breaks were long recently, so even office interactions might feel better now. Being around people, even for work, is important.

The team is very kind, like at my previous job. Maybe it's because it's my first day, but they patiently explained the product and how things work. Even if professional, kindness from people feels nice. I forgot this feeling. 

Interestingly, not everyone was in the office today. Some took the day off, including someone who took leave today and tomorrow for the release of "Pokemon Z-A." They didn't hide it, with Pokemon plushies and a Pokemon-inspired icon at their desk. I haven't met them yet, but it's clear they're a huge fan. I get it; I've been to the Pokemon Center twice recently. I'm looking forward to meeting them next week.

There wasn't a group lunch or drinks today. I skipped lunch, focusing on first-day work, and didn't eat anything as mentioned at the start. I'll eat after I finish writing; by then, it will likely be the next day. I'll wrap up my birthday without eating. 

I think socializing at work occasionally can be nice, but the team doesn't seem that way, though the atmosphere is pleasant, and everyone's kind, making me feel I can settle in comfortably.

Today, after about eight months, I finally shopped at a convenience store. My last visit was at a 7-Eleven on February 4. Since October started, I felt like visiting a convenience store, realized it's been about eight months, and decided to wait until my birthday to treat myself. Though I've been inside briefly with friends, buying to eat at home hasn't happened since February 4. I'll enjoy the convenience store treats after finishing this blog. Spending a whole day not eating makes me look forward to it, even if it turns out to be late-night snacking.

I plan to move away from quitting jobs impulsively and having work gaps. Wandering around feels easy at the time, but becomes tough later. Turning 30 is a change, so I want to face work seriously. My dissatisfaction with capitalism and difficulty staying motivated in hired jobs haven't vanished. But I need work to live, so I'll focus on making it enjoyable and less burdensome as I consider my future.
