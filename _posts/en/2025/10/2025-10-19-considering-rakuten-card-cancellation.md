### Do I Really Need a Rakuten Card?
As I wrote in [considering the necessity of my current credit cards](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/credit-card-necessity), one of the credit cards I have is the Rakuten Card. I signed up for it when I got my Rakuten Mobile plan. For more details, check out my post on [signing up for Rakuten Mobile (MNP), Rakuten Card, and buying an iPhone 13 Pro](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/rakuten-mobile-and-card-and-iphone).

But I'm starting to think I might not need this card anymore, so I've decided to gather my thoughts on that.

### It's Only Used for Rakuten Mobile
First of all, I use the Rakuten Card to pay for Rakuten Mobile. I think it's also linked to Rakuten Pay, but since I use PayPay, I hardly ever use Rakuten Pay. The only time I open the Rakuten Pay app is when I'm trying to earn Rakuten Points at Seiyu[^rakuten_pay_app]. So practically, I only use the Rakuten Card for Rakuten Mobile payments.

[^rakuten_pay_app]: It's really annoying to log in again just to earn points, and the touch detection for banner ads is terrible—when I try to press the close button on the top right, I end up clicking the ad, which opens in a browser. It's especially frustrating when this happens right before I'm about to pay at the register. I really wish they would fix this.

Because of this, the points I earn are limited. It's nice that I can use those points to pay for Rakuten Mobile, but I really don't feel like I'm accumulating a lot of points. I chose Rakuten Mobile because it's cheap, and I don't go out much or use a lot of data-heavy apps like mobile games. So my data usage is minimal, and the points I earn are hardly noticeable.

With Rakuten Mobile, as long as I use less than 3GB, my bill is just 1,078 yen. As of October 19th, I've only used 1.78GB this month. There's still plenty of room before the month ends.

![Data usage for this month](https://noraworld.github.io/box-ivysaur/2025/10/19/6a567a9f3823873d61754f139223e856.png)

Even over the past 60 days (about two months), I've only used 4.10GB (averaging 2.05GB per month)[^rakuten_mobile_data_usage]. There are plenty of days when I don't use even 0.01GB.

[^rakuten_mobile_data_usage]: It's inconvenient that I can only check my data usage up to 60 days in the past. Why can't I see my usage for a longer period?

![Data usage over the past 60 days](https://noraworld.github.io/box-ivysaur/2025/10/19/3b75526bd4959e241d27b706de25eb83.png)

As for the Rakuten Points I earn from shopping at Seiyu, that has nothing to do with the Rakuten Card. So then, what are the benefits of using the Rakuten Card? I started wondering this while writing [about my past credit cards](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/successive-credit-card). Upon further investigation, it turns out that Rakuten Mobile allows for credit card payments with cards from other companies.

### Examining the Unnecessity
So, I looked into the [benefits of using the Rakuten Card with Rakuten Mobile](https://appllio.com/rakuten-mobile-rakuten-card) to see if it's truly necessary for me. I'll be writing based on the benefits listed in that external article.

#### Benefit 1: Giga Discount Coupons
This is a new benefit that started in July. It allows for 5GB or 10GB to be deducted from your Rakuten Mobile usage, lowering your bill. For example, if you use 20GB in a month, you'll only be charged up to 15GB or 10GB. It can supposedly save you up to 1,100 yen.

However, this only applies to the Rakuten Premium Card (for 5GB) or the Rakuten Black Card (for 10GB), not the regular Rakuten Card I have. So this doesn't benefit me.

And as I mentioned earlier, I don't consume much data, so this isn't advantageous.

Moreover, both of these cards have annual fees ([Rakuten Premium Card](https://www.rakuten-card.co.jp/card/rakuten-premium-card/) costs 11,000 yen, and the [Rakuten Black Card](https://www.rakuten-card.co.jp/card/black_card/) costs 33,000 yen), which means I wouldn't be able to make the most out of them.

#### Benefit 2: No Installment Fees for Devices
When purchasing a device through Rakuten Mobile, you can opt for 24 or 48 monthly installments, and you won't incur any installment fees if you use the Rakuten Card. This is a significant advantage if you go for the 24/48 installment plans.

I actually took advantage of this when I bought my iPhone 13 Pro in 48 installments. [I made the purchase on October 22, 2021](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/rakuten-mobile-and-card-and-iphone), and I just recently finished paying it off. I incurred no fees, effectively paying the same as if I'd paid in full at the start.

While this was beneficial, I've decided to avoid deferring payments in the future, which means I won't be using installment plans anymore. If I can't pay for a new iPhone outright, I shouldn't be getting one at all. For these reasons, this isn't a benefit moving forward.

Normally, installment plans have fees, and if you want to avoid them, you should pay in full. If you can't pay in full, you shouldn't buy the device at that time, which is why managing your financial goals becomes challenging later. And this no-fee benefit is limited to devices like iPhones and Androids, which should ideally be bought upfront.

This is a reminder for myself. Hence, to avoid relying on installment plans, this should not be counted as a benefit.

#### Benefit 3: Upgrade Program
This program allows you to return a device purchased through Rakuten Mobile on a 48-month installment plan after 25 months, freeing you from further payments. If you want to upgrade your iPhone every two years, this is recommended.

[It used to be called the "Rakuten Mobile iPhone Upgrade Program," and my iPhone 13 Pro is eligible](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/rakuten-mobile-and-card-and-iphone#%E6%A5%BD%E5%A4%A9%E3%83%A2%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB-iphone-%E3%82%A2%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%82%B0%E3%83%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%83%97%E3%83%AD%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A0). I never returned it, though, and ended up paying all 48 installments, so I didn't benefit from this.

Since this program is also based on installment payments, I'm planning not to use it like Benefit 2. Plus, as I noted, I didn't even use this program, and returning devices partway is troublesome. I just thought, "It's working fine, so it's okay." I don't feel the need to upgrade my iPhone every two years. Well, I do want a new iPhone now, but this desire only arose about four years after I got my current one, which makes two-year exchanges less appealing to me.

#### Benefit 4: Up to 7x Points in Rakuten Market
This can be summed up in one sentence: I don't use Rakuten Market, so it's unnecessary, period.

Even though it sounds appealing to earn up to 7x points, buying everyday items or groceries online is a hassle. I want them now, but I can't get them instantly, and for doorstep delivery, I need to be home and awake. The package locker might be full or unavailable. I usually end up using Amazon for gadgets, as they’re often cheaper and I still earn points there. As for books, I use Kindle exclusively, so I have no desire to switch to Rakuten's platform (Kobo, I think?). In short, I won't be using Rakuten Market anytime soon.

Overall, I feel this benefit only seems attractive if you're already part of the Rakuten ecosystem. I only use Rakuten Mobile and the Rakuten Card (which I’m considering canceling in this article). I don’t use Rakuten Bank, Rakuten Market, or Rakuten Securities. I don't see the point in forcing myself into the Rakuten ecosystem. Anyway, I rarely do online shopping now, buy my books on Kindle (Amazon), and don't own stocks (and would rather use SBI Securities if I did).

#### Benefit 5: Double Points on Rakuten Mobile Payments
I don’t think this is a benefit. It says other credit cards also earn Rakuten Points. If other cards can earn points at a 1% rate, there's no difference. With Rakuten Card, both types of points earned are Rakuten Points, making it easier to use them on the next Rakuten Mobile bill. But if other cards are just as convenient, it’s not significant.

Plus, I have a Recruit Card with a 1.2% reward rate, which is higher than Rakuten Card. Recruit Points can be used on Amazon, so it’s not inconvenient (though admittedly, I don’t shop online that much anymore). Thus, this isn't a real benefit for me.

#### Benefit 6: Rakuten Saikyo Plan (Data Type)
The [Rakuten Saikyo Plan](https://network.mobile.rakuten.co.jp/fee/saikyo-plan/detail/) can be used without a Rakuten Card, but there's a [Rakuten Saikyo Plan (Data Type)](https://network.mobile.rakuten.co.jp/fee/saikyo-plan/data-type/) that requires you to be a Rakuten Card member.

The difference is that, in exchange for not being able to use phone calls or carrier emails, the data plan is cheaper. Up to 3GB is 968 yen (as of October 19, 2025).

This isn't a benefit for me at all. As I've been saying, I'm mostly at home, so I don't use much data. Benefits that reduce the cost of data are not very appealing. And anyway, the regular Rakuten Saikyo Plan is 1,078 yen for up to 3GB, which isn't all that different.

The biggest issue is that not being able to use my phone would be inconvenient. If it were an additional plan alongside another carrier, I could see the point. But since I use this as my main line and don’t want to carry a secondary line (it's unnecessary), not having phone services would be problematic. I don't make calls often, but sometimes I do need to call or be called by places like the tax office or health insurance, and I also need a phone number for various contracts, which makes this "Data Type" service unsuitable for me.

So, I won't be signing up for the data type plan. This benefit isn’t useful for me.

### Conclusion
I've concluded that the Rakuten Card is unnecessary. This is purely when considering it with Rakuten Mobile; I'm sure Rakuten Card offers other benefits as well. But right now, I only use Rakuten Mobile, and even if there are perks, I don't plan to start shopping on Rakuten Market or investing through Rakuten Securities. Even if I continue using Rakuten Mobile, it’s clear to me that the Rakuten Card isn’t necessary.

As I mentioned in my post on [signing up for Rakuten Mobile, the Rakuten Card, and purchasing the iPhone 13 Pro](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/rakuten-mobile-and-card-and-iphone), I made all these contracts in October 2021. The Rakuten Card has a 5-year validity, which means it expires next October, in about a year.

I might change my mind, so I don't think I'll cancel it immediately. Plus, I need to change my Rakuten Mobile payment method before I cancel it, so it's not something I can do right away. But if my situation and decisions don't change by next year as the expiration date approaches, I'll proceed with the cancellation process. Based on my past experiences, a notice of cancellation a few months ahead seems wise because they often start renewing your card way before it actually expires.

According to [the article I mentioned earlier](https://appllio.com/rakuten-mobile-rakuten-card#h310), Rakuten Mobile payments can be made by credit card, debit card, or bank account transfer. However, bank account transfers incur a 110-yen fee, which is surprising. I thought direct debit would be good since I don’t like deferring payments, but if there’s a fee, I'll likely use a credit card. Bank transfers don’t earn points anyway. Debit cards provide immediate withdrawal without fees, but I don't have any currently. Getting one just for this is a bit much.
