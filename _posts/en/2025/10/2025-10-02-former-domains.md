### Introduction
Recently, I organized the DNS records for my primary domain, `noraworld.com`. There was no particular need to tidy it up, but it felt like doing a spring cleaning.

Currently, I only own this one domain, but I used to be a domain enthusiast, owning around 15 to 20 domains. Since I'm cleaning up my domains, I thought I'd summarize the domains I've acquired over the years.



### List of Domains
⚠️ The domains listed in this article (except `noraworld.com`) are no longer in my possession. Malicious third parties might have acquired them and could misuse them. So, please be cautious and avoid accessing them without understanding the risks.

[^google_domains]: Now part of [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/).

I can't guarantee that this is all of them. Some domains might have expired before I made this list because they weren't set to auto-renew. I actually created this table as a memo on March 26, 2022 [^memo_deletion], but by that time, I was already far removed from maintaining or acquiring new domains, so some had already expired or weren't recorded.

[^memo_deletion]: Personal memo: I deleted my [private memo](https://github.com/noraworld/memo/commit/c1a82a9e9c881737ef939d89b606d0c66e836e88) since this article was written.

The "Unknown" sections might be clarified by looking through past invoices or records. I might check them out if I feel like it.



#### `noraworld.com`
The only primary domain I currently still own. During the recent DNS record cleanup, I deleted everything except the SOA, NS, MX, and SPF records. A while back, I hosted a [simple portfolio](https://github.com/noraworld/noraworld.com) on this domain, but it was left as a draft and a simple link collection for years, so I eventually turned off GitHub Pages as it became unnecessary. Previously, I hosted my blog, diary, Mastodon, and other websites using this domain. Most of these migrated to the later-mentioned `noraworld.jp`.

Currently, it's set as the primary domain for Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) and is used for my Gmail address. I don't use it for anything else.



#### `noraworld.jp`
The first domain I remember acquiring. Initially, `noraworld.com` was cyber-squatted by a company and sold at a high price. The details are in [I acquired the premium domain noraworld.com for 300,000 yen](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/get-noraworld-com).

At that time, as a university student, I wanted to acquire `noraworld.com`, which cost around 430,000 yen—a price far out of reach. So, I temporarily gave up and got the `noraworld.jp` domain instead. Until I acquired `noraworld.com`, I used `noraworld.jp` as my primary domain for my portfolio, blog, diary, Mastodon, and other sites.

I subscribed to Google Workspace (G Suite) with `noraworld.com`, so I didn't use `noraworld.jp` for emails. I had plans to use a custom domain for emails, but since I intended to eventually get `noraworld.com` and switch domains, I wanted to avoid the hassle of migrating emails later. Websites can be redirected, but emails can't (although they can be forwarded).



#### `noraworld.blog`
Originally, I ran the blog at `blog.noraworld.jp`. Then, when I learned at 1:00 AM on November 22, 2016, that `.blog` domains became available, I got excited, thinking they were perfect for blogs, and acquired one right away, making it my blog domain.

I managed both `blog.noraworld.jp` and `noraworld.blog` using Ghost, a blog CMS. But when I transitioned to [Jekyll, a static site generator, and stopped using custom domains](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/ghost-to-jekyll), I decided to let this domain go. Though my past content (blog posts) was carried over, I didn't use these domains for Jekyll.



#### `noraworld.net`
I wanted to avoid accessing external websites whenever I needed to check my public IP address or browser request headers (languages, referrer, etc.) because it seemed like a privacy risk. Also, as a university student with a thirst for technical knowledge and a curiosity for PHP, I wanted to create a website to check these myself. I used `noraworld.net` for that. The code is still on [GitHub](https://github.com/noraworld/noraworld.net).

During my university days, I had ample opportunities to learn about web security, which made me overly cautious about online privacy. I had created this personal website as a youthful endeavor, but as I stopped using it, I decided to let go of the domain without much hesitation.



#### `noraworld.io`
In university, I wanted to create a tool to display the current time in real-time and perform Base64 encoding/decoding, so I implemented it in JavaScript and distributed it via GitHub Pages, using this domain. Of course, I was aware there were many similar tools out there, but I made it as a hobby to understand (like Base64) mechanisms and enhance my technical skills (I also wanted to try using Bootstrap as practice).

Though I no longer own the domain, the website itself runs on GitHub Pages and is still accessible at [`noraworld.github.io/utils/`](https://noraworld.github.io/utils/). The repository was once named `noraworld/noraworld.io`, but since I stopped using a custom domain and found it inappropriate, I renamed it to [`noraworld/utils`](https://github.com/noraworld/utils).

Incidentally, `noraworld.net` used to run on a VPS because a server was necessary for obtaining public IP addresses and such. The VPS contract has also ended, so it's no longer available.



#### `noraworld.me`
I recalled this while finishing up this article [^me]; I think I had `noraworld.me`. But it wasn't on the memo list, and I had forgotten about it until just now, so it must have expired without me realizing it. Maybe it was set to not auto-renew, or it expired because a university-era payment method was invalid. I mean, I had it, right? I feel like I did. Wait, didn't I? My memory is so hazy...

[^me]: "`.me` is Montenegro," as I once noted.

Anyway, it's clear I didn't end up using it; I'm certain about that. I don't think I planned to use it for anything. I probably just thought of reserving it for namespace purposes. When or where I got it, I have no idea.



#### `noraworld.dev`
I acquired it for namespace purposes when `.dev` domains became available. But by this time, I was already disinterested in managing servers or operating websites myself, as described in [Transition from Ghost to Jekyll](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/ghost-to-jekyll). Holding important data on personal servers didn't motivate me anymore given my data management policy. I got it thinking I might use it someday and that I'd regret not getting it if someone else acquired it. But I never used it, so I let it go.



#### `noraworld.media`
Acquired for hosting images for an old diary site and Mastodon distribution. Initially, images were hosted on the same storage as the web server with a front-end domain of the same name. But when moving the image distribution to AWS S3, I wanted to assign a dedicated domain for it, hence using this one.

I got the idea from Wikimedia, which manages Wikipedia's images. Separating image-hosting domains from front-end domains is common practice [^image_hosting], but I've never seen `.media` being used like this. Personally, I think `.media` is a pretty fitting domain, and I hope it becomes more popular.

[^image_hosting]: For example, `ytimg.com` for YouTube's video thumbnails, and `twimg.com` for Twitter/X post attachment images.



#### `nora.to`
A short domain, acquired to create my own URL shortening service. It was meant to be my custom version similar to Twitter's `t.co` or Google's `goo.gl` [^goo_gl].

[^goo_gl]: Apparently, it completely ended this August. I knew that new usages became impossible quite a while ago (March 2019, to be exact), but I didn't know that existing URLs were also inaccessible until this August. [Google to End URL Shortening Service "goo.gl" by August 2025 - ITmedia NEWS](https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2407/19/news093.html)

As I was running various websites, there came a fancy that I'd like to create and use my own URL shortening service out of my burgeoning technical interest as a university student and my newfound desire to play with Python, specifically Django.

Although I penned the concept, I never ended up building it, so I decided to let this domain go as well.



#### `nora.dev`
Acquired for the same reason as `noraworld.dev`. Since it was right after `.dev` domains became available, many short domains were still up for grabs. Like `noraworld.dev`, I eventually didn't use it and decided to let it go.

Incidentally, `nora.dev` was set as a premium domain and cost over 30,000 yen per year. Knowing this, there was a desire to acquire precious domains even if I wasn't going to use them right away. If a premium domain could be obtained then but might be gone when truly desired, it would have been a missed opportunity I'd regret, hence the acquisition.



#### `nora.world`
Domain hack for `noraworld`, a username primarily used online. By this point, I had already decided to use `noraworld.jp` as my primary domain and intended to replace it with `noraworld.com` as the primary domain in the future. I never thought of making it my primary domain. Though it's indeed satisfying to own a domain hack domain, I personally never felt like using one as a primary domain; I preferred general ones like `.com` as my identity. As such, it ended up being something I owned but never used. At one point, I did think about using it for an email address, though.

Interestingly, the acquisition was prompted by a question from a junior during a university club's Christmas party and subsequent drinking event: "Do you own `nora.world`?" As noted in [The RCC Christmas Party](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/rcc-xmas-party-2016), while the embedded Twitter widget is no longer available due to the account's deletion, the `https://t.co/MBWMsVISyD` link was redirecting to `nora.world`. At the time of writing, it seems GoDaddy has cybersquatted the domain and is selling it.



#### `kosu.ke`
A domain hack using my real given name, acquired for contact purposes with family and associated parties. It was an excellent identity as `aoki@kosu.ke`. However, by this time, I already had `noraworld.com`, which I've been using for quite a while, so there wasn't a spark or excitement to make this my primary. Thus, I used it for family contacts, which was initially why I decided to acquire it anyway.

Initially, contact with family was via SMS (text messages). Due to a strained relationship, I wanted to minimize contact, but my family insisted on keeping a communication line open, threatening to call the police if cut off. Understanding this need, I maintained a communication method.

Yet, the iPhone's SMS app poses a challenge: it can't be added to Screen Time. Well, technically it can, but it comes with the risk of not receiving important notifications. Moreover, it is sometimes used for two-factor authentication, making it impractical to include in Screen Time.

Resolving this by creating a dedicated email for family contact, connected to a different mail service than I usually use, seemed reasonable. The chosen mail service was Zoho, meeting both the free and minor service criteria. By listing the Zoho mail app in Screen Time, I could limit notifications to specified hours, providing focus during other times.

However, initially, messages weren't received as they had blocked mails not from a carrier. After lifting this block, communication became possible, but eventually reverted to SMS for various reasons.

About `.ke` domains: as the Kenyan country code, it wasn't supported by major registrars like Squarespace (Google Domains) or GoDaddy, nor Japanese ones like Onamae.com or MuuMuu Domain. Therefore, I had to use [EAC directory](https://domains.eacdirectory.co.ke/clientarea.php?action=domains), a somewhat obscure Kenyan registrar.

It didn't offer the reliability of mentioned registrars. The support was slightly informal when I had pre-purchase inquiries. And before I even decided to let it go, it had already been canceled. I didn't explicitly turn off auto-renew or go through the cancellation process, but it disappeared without any notification. Of course, `.ke` isn't exclusively available here [^eac_directory], and since it wasn't used by the time I noticed, there were no practical concerns. However, it did reinforce that domains should ideally be acquired through trusted registrars.

[^eac_directory]: Surely not the only one, but among registrars from which it could be obtained from Japan, this seemed the most decent.



#### `cyberch.net`
The domain used for my university graduation research. The study's details are in my [graduation thesis](https://github.com/noraworld/graduation-thesis/blob/f21237271450ed0bf1562f58019c1e44c1a1d3ff/graduation_thesis.pdf), but briefly, it hypothesized whether, if a website with social media share buttons is hacked, and attackers are logged into that SNS, it can reveal the identity in collaboration with that service. For this experiment, I had a bulletin board site and used `cyberch.net` for its domain. As it was specifically for graduation research and would be unnecessary post-graduation, auto-renew was off, allowing it to be released after a year.

The bulletin board's source code is [cyberch](https://github.com/noraworld/cyberch), but as noted in its README, it's not my complete implementation. It was adapted from [LIGHT BOARD](https://www.kent-web.com/bbs/light.html) distributed by [KENT WEB](https://www.kent-web.com/). Adaptations were needed to set up SNS share buttons for my experiments.



#### `cybernet.social`
Like `cyberch.net`, this domain was used in my university graduation research. While `cyberch.net` hosted the bulletin board, `cybernet.social` was the domain hosting Mastodon.

Besides, Twitter and Facebook share buttons embellish the bulletin board for visual purposes, but since I don't operate them myself, it's impossible to access logs when a user logged into them accesses it. But for experiments like this, for log analysis of site visits via share buttons, I hosted and used Mastodon, employing self-hosted services. 

The then-used source code is at [cybernet](https://github.com/noraworld/cybernet). Though based on [Mastodon itself](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon), I neglected to fork it initially from GitHub—likely as my management wasn't GitHub-based back then. This is the same reason why my [graduation thesis](https://github.com/noraworld/graduation-thesis/blob/f21237271450ed0bf1562f58019c1e44c1a1d3ff/graduation_thesis.pdf) was published some time after graduation.



#### `blankpag.es`
Since my university days, I've been a long-time user of [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/), a browser extension. Not just Vimium, but browser extensions don't function on the browser's default new page (the built-in page displayed when a new tab opens that isn't a website). So, when opening a new, default browser page, accessing some random site was necessary before activating shortcuts (checking the bookmarks or tab lists).

To immediately use Vimium shortcuts, setting a specific website as the homepage seemed crucial. Ideally, a simple plain white page would load swiftly for accessing shortcuts, using this domain for hosting via GitHub Pages. `.es` is Spain's country code but available from major registrars.

Although I still used Vimium then, I ceased using bookmarks, making the instant shortcut function when opening a new tab obsolete. Conversely, certain functionalities I thought previously unavailable actually operate fine. I couldn't remember initial motives for new tab bookmarks or tab lists.

Moreover, page load speeds aside from content size-wise, which mattered, what's often crucial are caching, server performance, network strength (like geographic proximity), etc. Even during those times, [www.google.com](https://www.google.com/) was faster. It begged the question: why not make Google the homepage? Searching can be done via Vimium's search bar focus.

This domain wasn't listed in my memo, and before realizing, it had disappeared. Unlike `kosu.ke`, which had automatically canceled, due to lack of practicality, I likely turned off auto-renew and canceled it without recalling all details. I rediscovered the hosting repository via [blankpage](https://github.com/noraworld/blankpage), dedicated to almost blank HTML distribution.



#### `ffchecker.com`
Acquired for hosting a Rails implementation that listed Twitter followings and followers (aka FFs). It stemmed from my disdain for following accounts with whom I had no connections or interest once they unfollowed me but realized I needed a tool to list such accounts whose followings could be removed. That's when I developed this tool but ultimately decided not to use this domain.

I implemented it, and the source code is public on [ffchecker](https://github.com/noraworld/ffchecker). I planned to host this as a website but never did. The repository's Website setting was unfilled, evidence of my intention to manage it locally rather than through a public interface for simple confirmation.

As an add-on, the Twitter FF-checker [ffchecker](https://github.com/noraworld/ffchecker) had a Mastodon version called [mastodon-ffchecker](https://github.com/noraworld/mastodon-ffchecker). I probably hardly used this too.



#### `deshikai.com`
This was the domain used by the unofficial community of D Lab [^d_lab], also known as Deshikai, managed by Mentalist DaiGo. However, I wasn't the site operator, nor did I initially own the domain.

Soon after joining, Deshikai effectively disbanded. Though the Discord community lingered, offline meetings ceased. Consequently, `deshikai.com` no longer hosted the site and was initially released. Spotting it freed made me consider acquiring it since the community might someday return, and it would be a shame if a third party (likely a cybersquatter) snatched it to sell at a hefty price. I planned to transfer it back if that day came.

[^d_lab]: Formerly known as NukoMiko Videos, as I recall, yet possibly already D Lab by that time.

Frankly, the reappearance felt uncertain, and as someone not deeply involved in Deshikai's activities [^coordinator], compounded with a desire to declutter domains, it was easy to let go. So, I just kept it in anticipation of a possible handover scenario.

[^coordinator]: Though I was once informally tasked with coordinating, shortly after my joining, we found ourselves disbanded.

### Conclusion
Domains once owned can turn risky in the hands of third parties, leading to potential misuse. Moreover, should they expire by mistake or get released only for a later desire to reacquire, the high costs due to cybersquatting can be prohibitive. Although sharing previously owned domains typically isn't a wise practice, considering I no longer cling to domains (in fact, I prefer not using custom domains now), documenting my past as a domain enthusiast and commemorating the domains that never saw use led me to compose this article.

While I probably won't acquire new domains anymore, my fondness for domains remains. Upon encountering a website sporting a stylish or appealing domain, I often feel the itch to share. I know quite a bit about domain trivia and geeky facts (like ".me" being Montenegro or ".io" belonging to the British Indian Ocean Territory, along with the `.nico` owned by Dwango). Looking back at these domains, I can't help but feel nostalgic.
