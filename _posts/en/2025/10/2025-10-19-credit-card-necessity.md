### Introduction
Reflecting on [my past credit cards](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/successive-credit-card) made me reconsider my current credit card situation. I want to reduce the number of cards I have, so I'm taking a look at the ones I still have and use to see if there are any I don't need anymore.

### Current Credit Cards I Have and Use
Right now, I'm using 5 cards. I've left out the Wise Debit Card and NAB's Visa Debit Card because I haven't used them since returning home and probably won't need them unless I live abroad again.

| Card                  | Expiration Date | Conclusion |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| Rakuten Card          | 2026/10         | ðŸ‘‹ Not Needed |
| EPOS Card             | 2027/11         | ðŸ¤” Might not be needed if I move in the future |
| PayPay Card           | 2028/10         | ðŸ¤” Might be needed if I use PayPay as my shopping mainstay |
| Bic Camera Suica Card | 2029/04         | ðŸ¥° Essential |
| Recruit Card          | 2029/05         | ðŸ˜‡ Necessary unless there's a replacement |

#### Rakuten Card
I only use the Rakuten Card for Rakuten Mobile, and after reviewing its benefits, I think I could cancel it. I wrote more about this in [Considering Cancelling My Rakuten Card](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/considering-rakuten-card-cancellation).

Its expiration date is in October next year, so if I don't change my mind by then, I'll probably cancel it.

#### EPOS Card
I use it to pay my rent, as I've mentioned in [Revisiting My Past Credit Cards](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/successive-credit-card).

The current place I live only accepts EPOS for credit card rent payments. It's arguably better than direct debit in terms of earning points, but the EPOS-specific points system requires extra effort to use them, unlike something like PayPay that automatically applies them when paying.

[EPOS Points System - EPOS Card Website](https://www.eposcard.co.jp/epospoint/index.html)

Research shows that not all properties accept every credit card for rent, and not all accept credit card payments at all, which seems common. It increases the number of cards to manage, leading me to think direct debit might be simpler. However, since it works now and switching isn't convenient, I might keep it until I move, at which point I might cancel it.

##### Regular Use of Rent Credit Card Payment Services is Out of the Question
Interestingly, services allow credit card rent payment even if the property doesn't. 

* [Crecari Rent Credit Card Payment](https://crecari.com/service/)
* [RentEase - Credit Card Rent Payment](https://rent-ease.jp/)

They charge fees of 4.6% and 5.5%, so without extremely high rewards, it's not worth it over direct debit. These services seem more for emergency cash flow than regular use.

#### PayPay Card
I use it for PayPay transactions, which is my main choice for groceries, daily goods, and meals with friends. 

While other credit cards can be used with PayPay, it seems clear PayPay doesn't want them used, likely due to brand fees. They've announced plans to end support for other cards, which could mean theyâ€™ll eventually become impractical. Additionally, using other cards results in zero rewards from PayPay[^paypay].

[^paypay]: Although using a third-party card's rewards might not be a concern, given that double dipping on rewards isn't possible. Some third-party cards might exclude PayPay purchases from rewards though, which needs consideration.

[Announcements Regarding Use of Other Credit Cards Post-2025 - PayPay Notice](https://paypay.ne.jp/notice/20241205/f-creditcard/)

PayPay is the most widespread of barcode payments. 

[Market Share of QR Code Payments](https://squareup.com/jp/ja/townsquare/market-share-of-qr-code-payment)

My experience matches this observation. Given the limited success of other barcode payment systems and the use of PayPay for splitting bills with friends, having a PayPay Card may be necessary.

However, the downside is that PayPay isn't integrated with Money Forward. PayPay Card is, so credit purchases are manageable, but transfers aren't auto-recorded.

Since I often use PayPay for bill-splitting with friends, and can't always insist on paying the entire bill myself to manage it better, it is somewhat of a dilemma here.

#### Bic Camera Suica Card
I use it for the auto-charge feature of Suica. Since Suica requires regular charging and I'm not keen on manual charges, it's highly beneficial. Suica is essential in Japan for train travel[^ticket].

[^ticket]: Obviously, someone likely to avoid manual Suica charges would also regularly avoid purchasing train tickets.

Thus, the unique auto-charge feature of view cards (like Bic Camera Suica Card) makes it indispensable based on convenience.

I minimize non-commute usage though, because much like PayPay, its integration with Money Forward isn't perfect. Using it at non-train related commerce provides no detailed transaction info, requiring manual tracking.

And outside train stations, there's no auto-charge. Thus, added benefits are minimal[^suica_yield]. While some places only accept cash or Suica[^only_suica], ideally, usage remains rare enough to manage manually.

[^suica_yield]: There is an attractive [high charge rate benefit with Suica](https://www.jreast.co.jp/card/first/bic/).

[^only_suica]: Recently, my friend and I visited a ramen shop on October 9th that accepted only cash or Suica. With no cash, I used Suica. If rare, it's manageable; if frequent, it's cumbersome to log.

Restricting it to train use minimizes management hassles.

#### Recruit Card
It serves as my general all-purpose card when not designated for specific uses[^primary_card].

[^primary_card]: Previously, P-one Wiz was my main card until service suspension due to late payments, after which Recruit Card became the main card.

Its general reward rate at 1.2% is high, and the Recruit Points convert directly to Amazon use, offering great utility. Plus, the point expiration extends by a year with new points, reducing risk.

While reducing card numbers would ideally merge uses (e.g., combining main/general cards), most cards cater specifically to certain services, often at a lower general reward rate.

General spending cases (online shopping, subscriptions) suit a versatile card; hence, Recruit Card remains indispensable for now.

### Conclusion
Excluding the Wise and NAB cards, and potentially dropping the Rakuten Card, leaves me with 4 cards. While ideally I wanted 2, practically managing categories such as rent and key payment methods (Suica, PayPay) with their specific cards (Bic Camera Suica Card, PayPay Card) sums up to 4. It's reasonably consolidated, and I'll continue with this setup for now.

Credit card benefits and convenience evolve, so my selection may change. For now, keeping management simple without fixating on the current best choice seems wise.
