### Decluttering My Credit Cards
Recently, I've been organizing past possessions like [previous domains I owned](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/former-domains) and the [list of DNS records for `noraworld.com`](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/dns-records-decluttering). Among those items are my credit cards. Just as I was once obsessed with domains, there was a time when I was really into credit cards too. Different services and stores offer varying optimal point rebate rates, and some features are only available with specific credit cards.

### Downsides of Owning Many Cards
Here's a summary of the downsides I experienced owning many credit cards.

#### Increased Management Costs
Physically using credit cards has become rare nowadays. Even when used in physical stores, I've been using cashless payment systems linked to credit cards (like PayPay linked to a PayPay card or Suica linked to a View card), so there's no need to carry a wallet full of cards. Therefore, owning multiple credit cards doesn't mean having a bulging wallet.

For expenses, I use Money Forward, and for sensitive information like card numbers, I use 1Password. This means I don't have to input card numbers manually for online transactions, nor do I check each credit card statement individually.

However, managing a large number of credit cards still becomes challenging. Every credit card has an expiration date. When the expiration approaches, unless you've updated your address with the card issuer, there's a risk of not receiving your new card if you’ve moved. In such cases, you need to change your address with the credit card company and explain the situation to have a new card sent, which is a hassle. If you hold many cards, you must update your address with each service when you move and might forget to update some.

Also, even though I aggregate my statements with Money Forward, many sites have increased security through two-factor authentication, meaning every time I update transaction records, I might need to input login information manually (depending on the service). The more cards you own, the more frequent this becomes. Updating automatically is a big advantage, yet this issue negates the benefits of an aggregation service.

#### Stress from Sensing Greater Expenditure
Another form of stress is feeling like you've overspent. When payment methods are scattered, by the end of the month, during deductions, you might often think, "Did I really spend this much?" There's data suggesting when bank accounts are dispersed, it's harder to grasp total funds, leading to potential overspending. The same psychology likely applies to expenditures.

#### Risk of Point Expiration
Additionally, the frequent expiration of points was another reason for my desire to let go of many credit cards. A major perk of credit card usage is the points you earn. However, with different credit cards offering various types of points (like V points, Ponta points, or d points, etc.) and stores having varied acceptance, it gets complicated. Tracking how much you've accrued per point service can also be tedious, leading to point expiration. For instance, T points (now V points) expired without any notifications, and I lost about 6,000 yen worth of points—a rather sneaky service.

### Decision to Let Go
Apart from feeling overwhelmed by managing so many credit cards, as I mentioned in my post on [considering debit cards after five credit cards were put on hold](https://noraworld.github.io/blog/debit-card-reunion), last year five of the cards I was using (with no intention of letting them go) were suspended due to late payments. Most of these entries ended up on a blacklist with the card issuer, preventing me from applying for new cards with them (or any affiliated cards) for probably five years.

Seeing this, I realized I'm not adept at managing a large number of credit cards. Hence, I've decided not to increase my number of credit cards moving forward. Before five cards got suspended, I was already actively closing cards deemed unnecessary. One of the suspensions was due to a financial hiccup, but since they've been resolved, it seems an apt time to revisit the cards I've owned and currently use.

### Card List
The following table represents information at the time of writing. Details are as of that time, and the holding status reflects the current situation. This table serves as a record of the writing at this moment and isn't planned for future updates. If there are significant changes in the future, I'll write another post.

#### Mitsubishi UFJ-VISA
This wasn’t a credit card but a debit card. I made a Chrome extension during my university days, and when uploading it to the store, I needed to pay an initial registration fee. At that time, I didn't have a payment method for online transactions (and probably opted for COD for Amazon purchases), so I decided to get a debit card.

I recognized the risk of having a credit card as a student (despite having student cards with limited credit), so I opted out. Whether I researched it later or knew of it beforehand, I thought getting a debit card was easier and decided to get one as I only needed it for the Chrome extension.

I chose Mitsubishi UFJ-VISA simply because my individual bank account was with Mitsubishi Tokyo UFJ Bank (now Mitsubishi UFJ Bank).

Its expiration was January 2021, so I told them I wouldn't renew it and started the cancellation on January 5. On January 29, I rechecked and confirmed its cancellation on January 8. After its cancellation, I kept the physical card like a collection, but I shredded it three years later on February 3, 2024.

I can't recall when I got it, but given its January 2021 expiration, being during my university period (2014 - 2018), and considering the logical durational period of five years, it seems it was likely January 2016.

Incidentally, I've just found out it ended service on January 8, 2022. Debit cards might not have been popular; some subscriptions indeed can’t use them.

#### MUFG Card
I began using online payments more frequently post-university. Though I can't recall precisely, U-NEXT didn't accept debit cards, and considering this might occur again with other services, I decided to issue a credit card. It became my first credit card after the debit card.

I distinctly recall getting it during my lunchtime break at a nearby UFJ bank after starting my first job (before the rise of remote work). I skipped lunch but still went over an hour, which remains in my memory.

Having a credit card was my primary reason for getting this card; I paid no attention to return rates or benefits. Much like the Mitsubishi UFJ-VISA, it simply came from using a UFJ bank account.

However, its return rates were low compared to general cards, provided no particular advantages, and came with a 1,100 yen annual fee, leading to my decision to cancel it. By then, I'd acquired other (fee-free and higher return) cards, marking it obsolete.

Though its expiration was April 2023, I canceled it on February 1, 2021, and shredded it on February 3, 2024. Considering I canceled the Mitsubishi UFJ-VISA around the same time, I likely began terminating unused cards starting in 2021.

I don’t remember the acquisition time, but surmise it was April 2018, shortly after starting my job, based on card lifespans.

#### Amazon Mastercard
Initially a gold card with an 11,000 yen annual fee—here’s why it's more nuanced:

With a "My Pay su Revo" choice allowing revolving payments, there’s a 5,500 yen discount; opting for web statements offers a 1,100 yen discount, dropping the annual fee to a practical 4,400 yen.

I thought it was high but, due to a perk, linking the card to Amazon.co.jp gave me Prime membership. Though I've forgotten the exact price, Prime cost over 5,000 yen annually back then, meaning this card’s annual fee was cheaper.

Additionally, buying at Amazon.co.jp with the card earned 2.5% in Amazon points—a remarkable rate. Moreover, Amazon awards points even for purchases made with points. If you buy a 10,000 yen item using 8,000 points and pay 2,000 yen cash, most services award points only on the 2,000 yen. However, Amazon gives points on the whole amount, so, in effect, you spend 1,750 yen. On Prime Day, for select items, the rebate rate doubles. Very generous.

I only sub to Prime sporadically now—rarely shop online or watch Amazon Prime Video—but used to often shop on Amazon, treating the Prime fee as infrastructural. In fact, several of my new grad peers owned it too.

But note: using it less than six times without web statements results in no annual fee discount, and using "My Pay su Revo" incorrectly defaults to revolving payments, accruing high costs. Sumitomo Mitsui likely intended this exploit.

The configuration allows setting “My Pay su Revo” to single pay, evading fees while getting 5,500 yen off. Feels borderline predatory but it works.

Amazon Mastercard remains though it's no longer special. It lost gold status, the annual fee, and Prime benefits, with a reduced return rate.

Despite still offering an advantage on Amazon, I planned to use it continuously. However, it was suspended as one of those cards caught up in unpaid debts. I think this card itself avoided non-payment, but Visa LINE Pay P+ from the same issuer had unpaid amounts, dragging this card with it. Though I've settled my dues, receiving another for five years is improbable.

Still, being less of an Amazon user, I'm not particularly troubled by this, having practically eased off Amazon even more post-suspension. If non-payment prompted this shift, saving money is a positive takeaway.

I owned three of these cards. The first came in May 2019, with April 2024 expiration, changing spec mid-term to a non-gold version (second-gen card issued May 2022). Both had April 2024 expiration. New specs arrived in March 2024 for a third version with April 2031 expiration, but were canceled by October 28, 2024, due to delinquency. Subsequently, the first and second cards were disposed of on February 3, 2024, with the third following its suspension.

#### Bic Camera Suica Card
Among various View Cards, it supports Suica convenience. View Cards are JR-issued, offering advantages and features for Suica users, including auto-charge, which is unique to View Cards compared to other credit cards. I acquired it mainly for this feature.

Given several [View Card types](https://www.jreast.co.jp/card/first/) available, my choice focused on:

- Potentially no annual fee
- Use outside Suica

If annual fees applied, I avoided it. With usage once annually, Bic Camera Suica Card became free, so I planned to make purchases or auto-charge to ensure no fees incurred.

On checking current offerings, it seems it's now the only one free with yearly usage. There might've been more choices earlier, though I may be misremembering. Unconditionally free options weren't present, I'm sure I'd have chosen them if available.

Based on assumptions about past options with similar conditions, I selected the card deeming Bic Camera possibly frequent and gadgets interesting. Though rare usage, stations or Lumine hold little relevance; hence, choosing this seemed logical.

Additionally, purchases at Bic Camera, being household electronic, mean considerable expenditure and associated point returns.

Bic Camera has a standard 10% return rate, reflecting slightly higher goods pricing than Amazon. This card gives the same rate for JRE points (transformable to Suica balance), though allowing easy expense use. I believe I've never used it in Bic Camera, or maybe once for a small item—mainly for auto-charge.

With 1.5% Suica spend cashback, you’d think this card would be great for shopping; however, summary statements indicate "Suica" which requires manual entry without clear vendor reports (often with a delay). It's primarily used for transport.

Despite the 1.5% cashback's charm, the absence of automatic JRE point conversions even exacerbates point loss. Unlike PayPay or Rakuten Pay, which priortize points deductions during payments, here it necessitates conversions manually, prompting minimal non-train usage.

Now in the second generation, the first card expired April 2024, and was shredded on February 3, 2024, for December 2029 expiration. Judging by a good guess, it seems closer to April 2019 by inception.

#### Yahoo Card / PayPay Card
Initially Yahoo Card (officially Yahoo! JAPAN Card), now evolved into PayPay Card. As the name suggests, it was acquired for PayPay use. With a Yahoo Card, PayPay purchases saw heightened returns (coupled with high-return promotions) which slowly reduced over time.

Eventually, its distinction faded, though retains an edge: now, payment through other cards is restricted, necessitating the PayPay Card for credit payments—except perhaps charge-based transactions (undetermined through casual check)—which I prefer avoiding as it's cumbersome. The PayPay Card hence becomes practically necessary for convenient PayPay use.

I hold no grudge against PayPay Card, but it's rather displeasing to assign a card just for a single payment method. Furthermore, lacking its past return generosity, it feels less gratifying to use to me. However, conveniences PayPay offers, supporting many stores, prioritizing point deductions, keeps me tethered to PayPay Card. Its resurgence to an infrequent purchase pattern further validates this association.

Issued June 2019 with June 2024 expiration, the transition to PayPay Card saw its entry into 1Password logged for November 2023. It’s currently my primary PayPay card.

Attempted on Yahoo! Shopping by November 27, 2023, Yahoo Card proved inoperative, invalidating its continued use, verified again over a call on February 2, 2024, indicating all Yahoo Cards became void during PayPay Card transitions.

While physically unused, I've physically shredded it on February 20, 2024. Similarly, some unused (yet valid) cards have undergone similar disposal.

On a side note, Yahoo Card could serve as a T Point card, but with T Points now replaced by V, I've not explored whether it’s still in use, partially due to losing over 6,000 T Points. Consequently, any accumulation effort is futile, akin to its V Point successor, confirming my restraint on such points. Rather obscurely, for non-frequent earners, expiration without warning causes loss, promoting savvy thrift toward point systems.

#### P-one Wiz
Distinct from Amazon Mastercard, Bic Camera Suica Card, and PayPay Card, offering high return rates on specific services as primary reasons for use, P-one Wiz functioned as my primary card. Its past tense signifies its cessation due to a delinquency-based suspension—another card caught in non-payment. Unlike Amazon Mastercard by Sumitomo Mitsui, this card was by Pocket Card.

It takes the primary card's spot also for its return rate (annual fee-free usage set a foundation). Amazon or PayPay Card ensures returns on platform-exclusive purchases, while general uses would benefit from a high-return card, presenting P-one Wiz as topping my search, offering the highest general return known to me.

Instead of the 1% incentives seen in Amazon Mastercard and PayPay Card, P-one Wiz affords [1% automatic off](https://www.pocketcard.co.jp/card/card_ponew.html) plus returns on spending ([earn points](https://www.pocketcard.co.jp/service/point/accumulate/)). Monthly expenditure of 10,000 yen would result in a payment of 9,900 yen; real money savings.

Atop of that, spending matches point collection—5 T Points worth per 1,000 yen. Essentially, a 0.5% point return equating to an effective 1.495% rate[^p_one_wiz] arises.

[^p_one_wiz]: Since points apply post-markdown, 99% × 0.5% = 0.495% occurs, summing up 1.495%.

Such high returns lacked contenders during search, standing atop findings without annual costs, definitive for primary use.

There’s a superior Recruit Card Plus, upstaging with 2.0%; unachievable yet superior to services like PayPay or Suica. Return obliteration forced the company on new issue openings, and now, [it stands at 1.5% starting March 16, 2026](https://recruit-card.jp/info/20250327/), which remains high.

Unfortunately, suspension by November 1, 2024, stilted further usage. P-one Wiz became entwined in diverse payment use cases, all requiring alternatives due to its halt.

While departures sideliners amplify relief slightly, automatic 1% markdown leaving none to lose and equivalent cash return drew high acclaim and return excelled. Struggling points usability remains problematic though.

Conversion remains imperative to redirect points to varying options. In variance, exchanges reflecting somewhat lesser gains, like Amazon gift certificates, which followed at 0.3% in mind. Further slack in usability from indirect point adherence occurs.

By aggregating statements in Money Forward, less visibility remains available resulting in lost points, firming expiration risks by non-notification, worsening over time. Akin to forced non-usage fulfillment, no value follows without convenience or usage.

The above issues, alongside expired T Points in thousands, force reflections on card usage styles. Lackluster point use akin to shed cash value occurs—missed usefulness halting returns’ essential benefits.

Issued June 2019, it should’ve hold until June 2026 but succumbed in expunction sooner. Maybe without its delinquency issues, retirement might still allow reflections on growing aversion to difficult point strategies.

Even now, residual debts continue from P-one Wiz, not quite due to huge debts during about one year but incremental choices in payment frequency with increasing economic strain prompted by [taxes](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A8%8E%E9%87%91%E6%94%A4%E5%8F%96%E3%81%99%E3%82%8B%E9%A0%85%E7%9B%AE) and insurance fees negating excess flexibility unto recent uneasiness too imminent to handle either P+

Continuing cards’ challenges in light of coordination mishaps furthers P-one Wiz’s candid regression into resolved corners, and eventual success stands as a target for sooner-than-later recompense.

#### d Card
NTT Docomo issued this card, despite having never contracted with them. Simple motivation drove acquisition: attaining 5% returns at Lawson's. This expired November 2020, so I canceled it, being irrelevant as a non-Docomo user.

Even for a Lawson habit, max 5% draws palpable; reason my acquisition, albeit preferring 7-Eleven chains typical such use rare otherwise. Above all, though my recollections are hazy, attaining said share meant presenting the d Point while utilizing iD for pay requiring manual steps for repetitive billing.

Collectively neglected, it reaffirmed as extraneousness once sans annual fees monitoring post February 3, 2024 disposal ceremonies; removing is a route for improved efficiency leading to disputes inclined towards closure sans regional services seen pointwise.

d Card offered d Points added services, which persisted even amid physical card destruction—card numbers put into digital forms accessible among apps, yet largely ignored.

Though d Card exhibited referenced conquering in nodding association, points would not accrue longer with rotational services seen unsettled following acquainted involvements, further hindering the advent of pace value adherence.

### Conclusion
These are the cards I've once possessed and currently own. Including non-credit card entries, there are about 20 cards. While I didn't acquire every contemplated card, I also considered others such as Kyash Card, WAON card (credit card combination), and Seven Card. 

For the Kyash Card, as mentioned previously, it didn't surpass the Kyash Card Lite. The WAON card was targeted due to frequent trips to My Basket and a desire to earn WAON points, potentially opting for the card/credit combinations, though approval repeatedly failed after multiple attempts. Mysterious criteria. For Seven Card, given my frequent 7-Eleven visits, it seemed logical, though overwhelmed by management burdens and eschewed acquiring another.

Again, no matter return rate heights, reward avenues must be considered. From experience, missed point potentials indicate rewards aren’t worth convenience management benefits superseding system milieus. Approached wisely, time outweighs minor returns.

Expenses, akin points, constitute flow assets seen without tangible cause-effect privacy. Tied fiscal content, saved, payouts end upon desync; indiscriminately extended, earned labels halt, returning capital void to scrutiny. Each exhausted bourgeons assets—nameprocessed and dubbed vanity retains discernment facade.
