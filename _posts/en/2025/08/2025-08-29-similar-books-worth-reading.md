Even if the content of books overlaps, they are still worth reading. Books with similar content can contribute to our memory and awareness in life. There are two reasons why repetition strengthens memory:

* Humans are forgetful, so seeing the same information repeatedly helps reinforce memory.
* If similar information appears in different books, the brain starts to recognize it as important, making it easier to remember.

A good example is books about health. Right after reading them, you might think that health is important and pay attention to your diet and exercise. But over time, you might start to slack off. Then, when you encounter health information again, you reconnect with its importance, but gradually the memory fades.

Health books often contain overlapping information, but reading them regularly helps you remember the importance of health. As a result, you might focus on your health more often and for longer periods, increasing the chances of staying healthy.

Regarding this, reading the same book repeatedly is fine, but if you only read identical content, you'll get bored and might start mindlessly scanning the pages. By reading different books with similar topics, you recognize that if another book you read before also mentioned it, it must be important. This helps the information stick in your memory more than reading the exact same book over and over.
