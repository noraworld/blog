Around 1:30 AM on August 2nd, after returning from a late-night walk and shopping, I noticed something moving near the washing machine. Turned out, a gecko had snuck into the house. It's on the 5th floor (4th floor in height), and the place is pretty sealed off, so besides the occasional spider or mosquito, we hardly get any insects inside. So, I was pretty surprised to see a gecko.

As soon as I noticed it, the gecko seemed to notice me too. Maybe it was my voice or my startled reaction that surprised it, causing it to dart away. It hid right behind the washing machine. There's hardly any space to get behind there, so once it slipped through, not much I could do. I was quite surprised by how quickly it moved, like a little lizard ninja.

I lost track of it behind the washing machine, and even if I hadn't, there's no way to really catch it back there, so I decided to just ignore it for now.

Then, the next day around 3:30 PM, I found it again, near the gap under the toilet door. It had moved from the washing machine to the bathroom in a day. I figured I could catch it there, so I quickly grabbed some chopsticks to try and capture it. It was fast and not easy to catch. It dodged and hid in the gaps between the join mat and the wall in the bathroom, but it was easier to target there. However, even when I grabbed it, it wriggled free and made its way to the gap by the front door, hiding just like before. I finally managed to grab its body with the chopsticks and catch it. I put it in a Ziploc bag to seal it inside for now.

To be honest, I really dislike bugs. If they get into the house, I generally kill them. I don't have time to actively kill bugs outside, but if they're in my house, it's like they're trespassing, so I have my own little rule that it's okay to kill them. Flying insects are especially annoying since they buzz around the room and distract me, so I try to kill them if I see them. Well, spiders are kind of useful sometimes, so I tend to let them wander around a bit.

Seeing a reptile like this after a long time felt similar to seeing a bug. Its quick movements reminded me of a cockroach. Not sure if it's the speed that triggers my distaste or just the scurrying motion itself, but seeing it slink around made me uneasy. It was hiding in the house for over a day, and even when I tried catching it, it kept running away, so I honestly thought I might just kill it. I have no hesitation killing things that come into my house uninvited.

But once I caught it and sealed it in the Ziploc bag, it suddenly calmed down (it had already stopped moving much in the gap by the front door, maybe it had given up), and watching it so motionless made it seem kind of pitiful. So, while I'm not planning to keep it as a pet exactly, I whimsically decided to just keep it around. I mean, it's not often you see a gecko, so just letting it go or killing it seemed like a waste.

The Ziploc bag was pretty cramped with barely any gaps to let it breathe, so I felt a bit bad about that. It was also inconvenient to leave it in a bag somewhere, so I decided to move it to a paper cup. Since it was sitting at the edge of the bag, I made sure it couldn't escape while moving it into a paper cup by placing it over the bag's opening. This transfer went pretty smoothly. But unlike the Ziploc, a paper cup isn't airtight, so I needed to cover the top. I used plastic wrap and taped it around the edges to keep it sealed in.

However, that would completely seal it off from fresh air, so I thought it might suffocate. So, I poked a few small holes in the plastic wrap with a toothpick to let air circulate.

Later, I noticed that I might have poked too many holes, and part of the plastic wrap ripped, so I reinforced those areas with tape to prevent escape.

After a while, around 5:30 AM on the 4th, I checked again, and it was still in the paper cup. Not surprising since there was no way for it to escape. I noticed it had left droppings in the cup. Also, something else caught my attention – it used to climb up the wall confidently, not falling off even when I shook the cup, but now it struggled to climb, easily slipping off. It seemed weaker.

A bit later, around 11 AM on the 6th, I observed it closely and noticed it had stopped moving. I thought it might have died. But with careful observation, I saw it was barely moving. Its body had turned entirely black since I caught it, so I guessed it was dehydrated and in critical condition. With the holes I had made in the plastic wrap, and the paper cup obviously not allowing in water, I decided to pour some water over the plastic wrap to give it some moisture. The holes were tiny, so barely any water got through, but even a small amount seemed enough for the gecko.

Same day around 3:30 PM, I checked again, and it seemed back to normal, its skin looking hydrated once more. It seemed like a lack of water was the issue after all.

Initially, I kept it on top of the washing machine, but since I have to move it when using the machine anyway, and it was in the way of towels and such, I moved it to the kitchen at some point. That way, I could casually check on it whenever I went to the kitchen.

I gave it water only once more after that. It seems they can survive quite well on small amounts of water. No need to give it water frequently.

I'm not planning to take responsibility for it like a real pet. I initially thought I might as well kill it. I'm just whimsically letting it live. Just a time killer. I've given it water, but I have no intention of finding food for it. My plan was to keep observing it until it inevitably died, thinking about feeding it now and then. I was also a bit unsatisfied as it had started hiding under the tape a lot.

As mentioned before, since the plastic wrap had too many holes and ended up tearing, I had patched it with tape. The cup isn't transparent, so that spot is a blind area. Of course, if I look closely, I can see it, but it's not very visible. I wasn't trying to shield or create blind spots for it to hide all day. I'm just whimsically containing it for amusement, like how we keep animals in a zoo for display. Not really thinking deeply about it. If I can't see it, there's no point to keep it alive. So, I wanted to remove the tape.

But even if I use another paper cup or plastic wrap, the wrap is fragile, and may tear again. And it's a hassle to transfer it every time, with a risk of escaping. Even with a successful setup, hardly any water would go in, and it's a hassle. And since the cup is white, I can only observe from the top, needing a bit of effort to see inside.

I didn't want to buy a special insect cage for reptiles. This is just temporary for the gecko that happened to wander in. I'm not paying for something like that. Another gecko probably won't get in again, and keeping a special case just for this seems wasteful. I'd prefer something I could also use for food storage.

I was thinking of buying transparent disposable plastic cups and using rubber bands for sealing, with a straw to supply water. But it seemed too elaborate and cumbersome to set up without letting it escape. So, I decided to check out plastic cups next time I went to the supermarket.

On August 13th, around 10:30 PM, I went to a nearby Seiyu store. Initially, I was planning to buy disposable plastic cups as intended, but I couldn't find any rubber bands in the same aisle, so I headed to the section with household items to look for some.

That's where I noticed a section with microwave-safe storage containers with small holes in the lid for air. This would be perfect for supplying water, ideal for keeping a gecko. They were cheap too, 199 yen for a pack of two, so I went with those, thinking I wouldn't need to worry about poking holes or setting up straws.

After getting back home, I immediately opened the storage containers and planned to transfer the gecko. I used a chopstick, as before, to make a hole in the wrap and tried to catch the gecko inside. This time, though, it put up a much more intense struggle than when I first caught it. At first, it darted around to escape, eventually slipping through the hole I made as it wiggled away from me.

Chasing the gecko around the kitchen, trying not to lose sight of it while desperately trying to grab it with the chopsticks, wasn't easy. It got into gaps fast. I could have grabbed it firmly, but I feared crushing it. Considering I went through the trouble to catch it and bought a container just for it, it would have been a waste if it died here. So, balancing a delicate grip, catching it became quite a task.

In the end, chopsticks weren't effective. When it climbed onto the cutting board, I brought the board close to the container, shook it off into the bin, and sealed it quickly. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be this challenging. While trying to catch it, I was so focused that it got my heart racing and blood pumping.

It wasn't dangerous, but I panicked because of the hassle of having to possibly find it again if it ran off, or perhaps because of its frantic movement and the idea of something like that loose in my apartment made me uneasy, or maybe because it resisted more than before.

After capturing it, somewhat ticked off after all that struggle, I dropped it with the container to show it who's boss. In hindsight, it may have been a bit immature, but when something irritates me, be it an insect or an inanimate object, this is my usual behavior, so I don't think anything of it now.

Then I opened the hole in the lid and added water. The hole was larger compared to the ones poked with a toothpick, allowing water to pass easily. To ensure there were no leaks and out of spite, I tilted the container to make the water chase it around, inspecting for leaks. Despite being cheap, it held up well with no leaks. At first, it seemed startled but later seemed to adjust or resign as it stopped reacting to the water. While I didn't intend to water-torture it, I was satisfied with watching it, then set the container back upright.

Another problem arose, albeit conversely. Indeed, it's much easier to add water than with a paper cup, but extracting water afterwards proved tricky. The hole isn't at a corner, so tipping the container barely drains any. Moreover, the hole sits in a recessed area intended to fit its cover, making it a tiny hill from the inside. So tilting the container doesn't really help drain water, probably intended for leak prevention but inconvenient when trying to remove excess water. Therefore, I must be careful not to add more water than necessary.

Evidently, the hole is large enough for water but not for the gecko to slip through. With its flexibility, it could hypothetically try squeezing through, but its head would likely get stuck as the hole size shouldn't allow escape. After giving it water and observing for a while, it has yet to attempt slipping out of that hole.

Should I seal the lid, it's completely airtight, making escape impossible. However, that could trap air within, risking suffocation, a possibility I want to avoid by leaving it open.

This story doesn't really have an ending, but I noticed it's still surviving more than ten days after being found on the 2nd and caught on the 3rd. Tough little thing. Whether it lives or dies, I'll keep watching it in the "sandbox" as a form of entertainment. Being unemployed and seldom leaving home, my life lacks novelty, so this little event was a rare change from the mundane, which is why I decided to jot it down.

Reflecting on past occasions where I've captured stray spiders and refused them freedom as well, I suppose while I claim dislike for insects or creatures, I perhaps enjoy observing them from a safe vantage point, or maybe it’s the part of me that naturally manifests when I trap them without food in an environment they can’t escape, watching them until they're gone.
