### First Sauna Challenge
As I mentioned in [Picky Eating Narrows Your Perspective](sauna-challenge), I went to a sauna with a friend on June 26, so I'll summarize my experience then. This was my very first sauna experience.

We visited Izumi Tenku no Yu at Haneda Airport. According to my friend, the hot springs and sauna at Haneda Airport are quite high-end. Indeed, the price was also a bit steep at 4,800 yen. I heard it used to be in the 3,000 yen range, but perhaps they've increased prices due to the rise in foreign tourists. In fact, we did see a few foreigners. Or maybe it's due to rising costs from inflation.

### A Light Meal
We didn't head straight to the sauna; first, we met up in Shinagawa for a light lunch. Since it was before the hot springs and sauna, we thought a light meal would be better, so we ate takoyaki at a food court around Shinagawa Station.

My friend mentioned wanting to try a steakhouse, but it seems they're only open at night on weekdays. Even if they were open, eating steak right before hitting the hot springs and sauna isn't ideal, so it was more of a reconnaissance.

### Haneda Airport
After some casual chatting at the food court, we left Shinagawa and headed to Haneda Airport Terminal 3 Station. Getting there was easy as the Keikyu Main Line Express goes direct.

Even after arriving at Haneda Airport, we didn't go straight to the sauna but strolled around the airport. We weren't boarding a flight, but airports have various facilities, so just walking around the commercial areas was interesting.

What left a particular impression was Edo-koji. The street was lined with shops replicating the Edo period's townscapes, which had a certain charm. I wish I had taken some pictures.

### Izumi Tenku no Yu
After wandering around Haneda Airport for a while, we finally headed to Izumi Tenku no Yu. Personally, I was curious about the luxurious-looking hotel attached to it, but we were there for the hot spring.

The facility was quite ordinary, nothing surprising. I haven't been in a hot spring in over 10 years, but it looked pretty much like I remembered. However, given it was located within Haneda Airport and the price was quite high, both the exterior and interior were very clean.

To avoid dehydration from sweating too much, we bought Pocari Sweat at a convenience store before heading to the hot spring.

At the locker area, my friend said, "I'll set it to 404 Not Found," to which I replied with, "Then I'll make mine 403 Forbidden," which made my friend burst out laughing (an engineer joke).

### Sauna Etiquette
My friend, who is familiar with saunas, asked me to follow the rules of etiquette. Here's the procedure:

1. First, wash your body and soak in the hot spring.
2. Enter the sauna and sweat for about 8 to 10 minutes.
3. Exit the sauna, rinse the sweat off under a shower, then soak in cold water for about 40 seconds.
4. Get out of the cold water and wipe off the body droplets.
5. Lie down or sit outside or in the bathhouse and rest for a while.
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5, 2 to 3 times.
7. Finally, soak in the hot spring again.

That's the flow, but there are more detailed etiquettes to follow at each phase.

There’s no specific time for being in the sauna room, but around 8 to 10 minutes is said to be ideal. However, as it was my first time, I was advised to start with around 6 minutes. Some people stay in for 12 minutes, but don’t push yourself too hard.

The crucial part begins once you exit the sauna; speed is of the essence. The effect is greater if you shower off the sweat and quickly dip into cold water. This is what they call "aligned." Since the extremities have concentrated nerve endings, they say not to immerse your hands in the cold water, but rather immerse your entire body up to your neck. This takes about 40 seconds.

Furthermore, wiping off body droplets is somewhat important. You lose heat from the droplets, so after exiting the cold water, it’s better to thoroughly wipe your body.

We repeated this 3 times, and I'll summarize the experience for each round.

#### First Round
First, I washed myself and got into the regular hot spring. As I had showered before leaving the house, I didn’t use shampoo or body soap in the hot spring, just a light rinse-off. Although the bath is large and the temperature varies by section, I soaked in a place that was about 37.5 degrees Celsius. It had been a long time since I came to a hot spring, but up to this point, I had experienced it as a child.

Then I entered the sauna room. There was a steam type, but this time I entered the dry sauna. My friend doesn’t particularly like steam. Upon entering the sauna, I felt immense heat. In the room’s back, seats were arranged in a staircase pattern, with the upper tiers being hotter. The lowest tier was 80 degrees, while the top was said to be 90 degrees by my friend. There were apparently 5 tiers, so each tier meant about a 2.5-degree increase. Since this was my first experience, I started from the lowest tier. My friend went one step higher.

The sauna room had a bit of a fear factor. The door handle felt like it would burn at a touch, and the hot air enveloped my body in heat. Breathing there was a bit scary; inhaling air stung my nostrils slightly. And that air was somewhat difficult to catch a big breath of. Talking meant inhaling extra, so I couldn’t speak much. It got a bit better once I tried placing a towel over my mouth, so I began doing that regularly.

Though I meant to stay for only 6 minutes the first time, I found it more endurable than expected, so I stayed an extra minute for a total of 7 minutes. Afterward, I exited the sauna room and rinsed off my sweat under a shower.

Here's where the hardest part comes: dipping into cold water immediately after the sauna. Even without being in a sauna, immersing in cold water is tough; the intense temperature difference made it rather dreadful. My friend plunged right in up to his neck, but the water's extreme cold forced me to enter bit by bit. Distracted by the cold, I accidentally submerged my hand, which wasn’t supposed to happen.

Somehow, I managed to submerge up to beneath my chest, but going up to my neck seemed too cold to handle. Technically, it felt possible with sufficient willpower, but concern about intense strain and erratic breathing convinced me that fully submerging might lead to a heart attack, so in the first round, I couldn’t go neck deep.

Once out of the bath, I moved to the outdoor hot spring and lay idly on a chair, gazing at the sky. I felt like my consciousness was drifting. I was a bit sleep-deprived, and it felt like I might doze off right there. It might have been an overwhelming sense of fatigue. Naturally, however, it wouldn't be appropriate to just sleep there and a sense of fear prevented me from closing my eyes completely.

That concluded my first round.

#### Second Round
The routine was to repeat 2 to 3 times, so we headed once more to the sauna room. Having roughly grasped the experience from the first round, my friend suggested we try staying a bit longer this time. So, the second round was about 8 minutes. Again, I stayed on the lowest 80-degree tier to sweat.

Breathing deeply still intimidated me, but I found myself somewhat accustomed to the heat. With my friend on the top tier, 8 minutes seemed quite tough for him, but personally, it wasn’t too unbearable. Perhaps I have a higher tolerance for heat than expected. Even so, it's not that staying longer is necessarily better, so we wrapped up at 8 minutes.

Once again, we took a cold plunge. Being more mindful not to submerge my hands, I entered cautiously this time. My body was still rejecting the idea of a quick full immersion up to the neck, but compared to round one, I braved more courageously and submerged myself adequately this time. Yet attempting to submerge beyond the chest felt suffocatingly scary, so I exited halfway.

Afterward, I headed back to the outdoor bath area, but this time just sat upright in a chair under the breeze for a while. Then I relaxed in the bathhouse's indoor hot spring maintained at about 37.5 degrees to rest my body. Given this was my first time, 2 rounds were probably enough, but I felt somewhat unsettled internally. What particularly bothered me was uncertainty regarding whether this really constituted "alignment."

According to my friend, when you exit the cold plunge and sit down, a wave of exhaustion overwhelms you, leaving you dazed and thoughtless—and that sensation is "alignment." While that sounded agreeable, I hadn't felt anything especially pleasant about it. If anything, I felt a sense of relief at completing an annoying task; it didn’t seem worth going to a sauna to experience this. In other words, it felt lacking in pleasure.

But I didn't want to have someone say "you're not following the rules" or "not giving it enough time," so I proposed doing one more round correctly, as instructed, giving it my all despite discomfort. It would likely be my last opportunity, as the experience wasn't compelling enough to ever consider returning voluntarily. 

#### Third Round
Determined to follow through properly on the third round, I aimed for persistence. The main sauna itself wasn't unbearable once accustomed, so with some encouragement, I dared to try a tier higher, probably around 82.5 degrees. My friend attempted an even higher 85 degrees.

With the one-tier increase, we agreed to 6 minutes initially and then add a minute if tolerable, entering. Frankly, there wasn't a notable difference between bottom and this tier, so after easily overcoming the initial 6 minutes, we added one more for a total of 7 minutes.

Then we faced the hardest step again: the cold plunge. Considering it unlikely to be fatal, I managed to suppress fear and immerse myself fully, holding hands above water for some time. Successfully abiding by my friend's complete advice brought confidence and a sense of accomplishment previously unattained.

Though the 40 seconds weren't precisely counted, they were more intuitive. When I mentioned exiting, it seemingly fell short, and upon checking with my friend, exiting was soon declared sufficient. I felt a slight sense of superiority and endurance over my friend, who often moved faster, deeming the 3rd trial more tolerable than anticipated.

Once more, we ensured body water was thoroughly wiped. Lacking significance in prior rounds, I paid it attention on the 3rd, finally resting indoors. My friend, seemingly entranced in “alignment,” closed his eyes, so I mirrored this action, closing mine to delve deeper into the experience.

In the end, "alignment" eluded my comprehension entirely. Listening was followed, and some similar sensation arrived but not one described by pleasure, more tinged with fatigue—both from fluctuating body temps and burdensome routine completion.

My friend validated my adherence to rules and times, meaning the discrepancy wasn’t simple error—it came from someone directly present, hence trustable. Unfortunately, no particular appeal emerged, leaving me resigned to "so that's what it's about." Yet gained experiences soothed that disappointment.

Finally, retreating to the outdoor bath let my body unwind. Higher than indoor baths, its temperature hovered around 40 degrees. Strong winds churned intensely. Unintentionally gulping minute hot spring droplets shocked with saltiness, thinking of others bathing, it incited an unclean feeling.

### Chatting Break
Post-bath, immersed in recliner-like seating and facing the sunset, we casually chatted. Recliners, unlike assumed massage chairs, were merely cushioned ones.

Recently, my friend became interested in someone, so I listened to their story. Likewise, I shared about meeting a woman from a dating app: going for lunch, capsule toys, and helping pick clothes. My friend got curious, presuming a new girlfriend, but I clarified seeing her more as a compatible friend.

While somewhat interested, they hadn't grown close enough for a relationship, my friend explained. Interest lingered daily with brief LINE messages exchanged, which progress I envied, jokingly declaring perceived ‘victory’ was premature and disputing it.

Thought of texting arouses distress over correct wording; conversation calls often baffle and prompt nonsensical chatter, they confided. Empathizing, I advised relaxed interactions akin to chatting with friends, avoiding self-sabotage by anxiety crippling aptitudes.

To advise what one struggles to action felt inherently hypocritical—all the same, relayed nonetheless.

Adjacent to our resting space, a zone allowed for stone saunas. The hot spring appears abundantly equipped. Nevertheless, the English signage seemed defective.

### Dinner
Preoccupied with conversations on recliners, until night fell unawares. Typically, we dine together during late meet-ups, but facilities potentially closing prompted an early search outside Izumi Tenku no Yu. Mentioned earlier, a somewhat costly fee was 4,800 yen.

Some stores shut amidst the night; however, others remained open. Generally airport-hiked priced, yet among them, a fish-centric eatery proposed reasonably priced offerings. Opting for dinner there allowed taste on affordability uncommon to our location.

Ordering their preferred Saba Set Meal, while I opted for Salmon Harasu.

Deeming my friend’s mackerel tastier, an exchange transposed regret upon former choice, as I wished swapped sides. While bones made it difficult, compounded by unfavorable brown rice to preferred white—displeasing as I discovered anew.

Departing after dinner redirected us back towards Shinagawa Station.

### Cafe
At approximately 22:00, a continued chat felt needed around Shinagawa Station. Though slight rain persisted, a 23:00 open PRONTO was found and entered. In bemusement, PRONTO presented elaborate dishes contrary to casual cafe expectations, reflected in reservation before closing-hour nearby ingress.

Upon ordering drinks, topics veered towards relationships. Normally involved in technical debates, cryptocurrencies, or stocks—this day revolved around "love talks." Neither friend nor I engaged seriously till now, but an increased yearn for companionship intensified reflective earnestness.

My friend previously experienced relationships, whereas I languished yet explosion manifested through our age. Urgency nor impatience felt ensuring all seriousness emphasized seeking heartfelt commitment.

Lingering in relaxed ambiance, until inevitable closing prompted exit. Stationary strolls surrounding Shinagawa Station entertained us until dissolution warranted through echoed pondering, "what do we wander aimlessly for?"

While a walk home from Shinagawa was feasible, headspace reintegration needed after spending the entire day with others—in ordinary retrospect, such intervals of contemplation occurred, yet the onslaught of rain displaced leisurely return and justified train usage.

### Reflections
Bare exposure has been a long-standing dilemma since childhood. Occasionally accompanied by forced attires into hot springs during trips with parents, independently visiting hot springs never arose as an adult—those invites remained nonexistent. Last memory recalls past events perhaps over 20 years prior.

Multiple sauna invitations arose through my friend, continually boasting sauna excellences; each gesture delicately countered through aversion to bare-bodied exhibitions, sparking repeated resignations. Though mildly disappointed, perseverance persisted upon frequent attempts urging attendance. Initially upon recent invite, reluctance emerged once more—were rejection repeated indefinitely, reassessing justified opportunity losses accompanied consecutive uncertainty.

Invitation acceptance ushered through latent prospects lest perpetual sauna inexperience would prevail. Enticement loss marked potentially significant experience. Abrupt enthusiasm failed to arise, yet trial merited undertaking.

Inevitably, sauna allure lay unnoticed, yet subsequent insight enlightenment rooted worthwhile endeavor recognition. While grounded expectations elucidated unfulfilled conclusions, knowledge acquisition evidenced modest worth, clarifying minor enlightenment dividend. Potential successive invites hold unlikely prospects; either personal disinclination or widespread bare exhibition discomfort endured unchanged. Acknowledging such fragmentary resolve, fees garnered male congregations compounded distaste—despite Haneda spot hailed high-end, widespread public assumptions anticipated augmenting unpleasantness.

Hiroyuki’s remark delineated conventional spatial bare-nature deliberations inherently improper abjured legitimate: fundamentally, tis abnormal—agreeably, society skews abnormally. Resort affinity fails overriding embarrassment notions; irrespective of locale or present congregants, unabashedness remains unchanged. Lest indulgent suitors emerge serendipitously at bestowal; anticipation denotes rare encounters not warranting enthusiastic embracement.

Hypothetically, speculative future travel engaged deliberative saunas—permitting context-driven uniqueness possible intrigue escalation. Conversely, lacking genuine voluntary commitment recurring participation sparks minimal interest fulfillment.

Preliminary undertakings occasionally disappoint align represented expectations, mirrored intentions shattered predictably. Today, a case in point, substantiated disappointments traced decisive events. Life embraces transient fleeting moments anchored in unpredictability. That's the way the cookie crumbles.

Notably, due to time lapse post-experience, finely etched memories hazed, enthusiasm waned, impeding comprehensive article completion—aptly emphasizing immediacy priority. Deliverance stems from time of incandescence.
