### First Sauna Challenge
As mentioned in [Avoid Picky Eatings to Broaden Perspectives](sauna-challenge), I went to a sauna with a friend on June 26, so I'm going to summarize what happened. This was my first-ever sauna experience.

I visited Izumi Tenku no Yu at Haneda Airport. According to my friend, the onsen and sauna at Haneda Airport are quite high-end. Indeed, the fee was quite steep at 4,800 yen. I heard it used to be in the 3,000 yen range before, but it likely increased due to the influx of foreign tourists. I did see some foreigners there. It could also be due to rising costs from inflation.

### Light Meal
We didn't head straight to the sauna, but first met in Shinagawa for a light lunch. Since it was before the onsen and sauna, we thought a light meal would be better, so we had takoyaki at a food court near Shinagawa Station.

My friend mentioned wanting to visit a steakhouse, but it seems they only operate in the evenings on weekdays. Even if it was open, having steak right before the sauna and onsen wouldn't be ideal, so it was just a reconnaissance.

### Haneda Airport
After some casual chatting at the food court, we headed to Haneda Airport Terminal 3 Station. The Keikyu Main Line Rapid Limited Express takes you directly there, which made it convenient.

Even after arriving at Haneda Airport, we didn't go straight to the sauna, instead we wandered the airport. We weren't flying anywhere, but since it's an airport, there were plenty of facilities to check out in the commercial areas.

What left a significant impression was Edo Koji. The shops were designed to mimic the streets of the Edo period, creating a quaint atmosphere. I wish I'd taken some photos.

### Izumi Tenku no Yu
After exploring Haneda Airport, we finally headed to Izumi Tenku no Yu. Personally, I was curious about the luxurious-looking hotel adjacent to it, but this time we went to Izumi Tenku no Yu.

The facility was pretty normal; nothing too surprising. I hadn't been to an onsen in over 10 years, but my impression was "Oh right, it was like this." However, being in a high-end facility like this at Haneda Airport, it was really clean both in appearance and interior.

Since you don't want to become dehydrated after sweating a lot, we bought a bottle of Pocari Sweat at a convenience store before heading to the onsen.

My friend joked about making our shoe locker number "404 Not Found" so I said I'd make mine "403 Forbidden," which had my friend in stitches (an engineer joke).

### Sauna Etiquette
Being accustomed to saunas, my friend asked that I follow the proper etiquette. Here's what it entails:

1. Wash your body and soak in the onsen first.
2. Enter the sauna room and sweat for about 8 to 10 minutes.
3. Exit the sauna room, rinse off sweat with pouring water, and soak in cold water for about 40 seconds.
4. Get out of the cold water, wipe off water drops.
5. Lie down or sit on a chair outside or inside the bathing area to rest for a while.
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for 2 to 3 cycles.
7. Finally, soak in the onsen again.

That’s the flow in its entirety, though each phase has its detailed etiquette.

As for the time spent in the sauna, there's no strict rule, but around 8 to 10 minutes is ideal. However, since it was my first time, I was told starting from about 6 minutes would be good. Some people can stay up to 12 minutes, but it's essential not to overdo it.

Speed is crucial once you leave the sauna room. It’s supposedly more effective if you rinse the body’s sweat immediately and dip into the cold water, achieving the so-called "tuning." Since fingertips concentrate nerve endings, your hands should not be submerged. Immerse your body up to the neck in about 40 seconds.

Wiping off the body’s water drops is quite essential too. Since they rob you of heat, it’s beneficial to thoroughly wipe them after exiting the cold water.

I did three cycles this time. I'll summarize what I experienced in each cycle.

#### First Cycle
First, I washed my body and soaked in the regular onsen. Because I took a shower before leaving home, I didn't use shampoo or body soap in the onsen but only rinsed off any sweat lightly. Since the bathhouse was spacious, each section had differing onsen temperatures; this time, it was roughly 37.5 degrees Celsius. It's been ages since I last visited an onsen, but this much I remember experiencing as a child.

Then, I finally entered the sauna room. Though there was a steam type available, I opted for the bathing one in all three cycles. My friend apparently doesn’t favor steam much. Upon entering the sauna room, I felt an overwhelming heat. It literally was physical heat. As you proceed into the room, there’s a section for sitting, gradually arranged in ascending steps. The higher you go, the higher the temperature. The bottom is 80 degrees, and the top reportedly reaches 90 degrees, as per my friend. With presumably five levels, each step up increases the temperature by about 2.5 degrees. As it was my first time, I started from the lowest level while my friend moved a step higher.

There was a slight anxiety about the sauna room. The door handle seemed like it could burn on touch, and the intense heat felt like it could ignite my body. More than anything, breathing was a little worrisome. Inhaling slightly hurt my nasal passages, and breathing deeply really seemed suffocating. Thus, I refrained from much talking as it required heavier breathing. Pressing a towel to my mouth made it somewhat bearable, so after realizing that, I kept a towel close to my face.

Although intending to leave after 6 minutes for a start due to it being my first, I felt surprisingly okay, so I added another minute, spending 7 minutes inside. I then exited the sauna room and rinsed off the sweat with pouring water.

Here came the toughest part: soaking in cold water right after. Entering a cold bath can be difficult even without prior heating, but with the drastic temperature difference following the sauna, it was extremely daunting. My friend submerged up to their neck in one go, but I couldn't due to the cold water's sharpness, hence entering gradually. Despite focusing on chilly water, I inadvertently submerged my hands too.

I somehow managed to submerge up to my chest, but going further to the neck was unbearably cold. To be fair, it seemed possible if I forced myself hard, yet the massive burden on the body led to heavy breathing and a lingering fear that submerging up to the neck might cause me a heart attack. Hence, I couldn't soak up to the neck during my first attempt.

After exiting the cold water, I moved to the open-air bath outside, reclined on a chair, and blankly gazed at the sky. I felt a sensation akin to consciousness fading. Due to prior lack of sleep, it seemed like I could drift off, experiencing a sense of fatigue. But of course, falling asleep on the spot wasn’t an option and an odd fear was present, so I kept my eyes open for a while.

That concluded my first cycle.

#### Second Cycle
Being told it’s usually repeated 2 to 3 times, I headed back to the sauna room. After getting a sense in the first round, my friend proposed extending the time a bit for the second. Thus, I entered for around 8 minutes this time. Again, I stayed on the lowest 80-degree spot to sweat it out.

I still had fears about taking deep breaths, but the temperature felt rather manageable. While it was fairly tough for my friend on the highest level, the heat seemed tolerable to me. Perhaps surprisingly, I might be the kind to withstand plain hotness. Although it felt like I could endure longer, seeing my friend struggle and knowing that extending unnecessarily doesn’t help, I stopped at 8 minutes.

Then, I immersed myself in cold water again, just like before. Since I’d mistakenly submerged my hands previously, I took care not to repeat it. Despite the body’s rejection and dreadful hesitation to submerge neck-deep in one go, gradually entering became somewhat courageous compared to the first round. However, attempting to soak up to the chest was met with breathlessness, leading to early withdrawal.

Afterwards, I visited the open-air bath again, but opted for sitting instead of reclining in a chair. Then, I re-entered the indoor onsen, once at 37.5 degrees, to rest. It was suggested that completing two cycles was adequate for a first try, but it felt unsatisfactory. The uncertainty about whether I was actually experiencing the so-called "tuning" lingered. Though my friend said I was feeling the overwhelming fatigue sensation essentially described as "tuning," akin to a mental void, it didn’t strike me as particularly enjoyable. Rather than being pleasant, it felt more like having passed a strenuous chore — a sense of relief from a hassle. In short, the pleasure aspect was undiscernible.

Still, recounting that experience to people who genuinely enjoy saunas only to hear, "You weren’t following the etiquette," might be aggravating. Hence, I wanted to do another round, carefully adhering to the described steps to perfection. Despite it being arduous and comfortless, warranting my desire to leave promptly, I debated while soaking in the bath, deciding to give a third attempt for this opportunity.

#### Third Cycle
For this third cycle, I resolved to adhere precisely to the procedure, enduring firmly. Realizing that, once accustomed, saunas aren’t unbearably taxing, my friend suggested advancing one level up. Presumably, this was a step to around 82.5 degrees. Meanwhile, my friend attempted another step up, likely at 85 degrees.

With the temperature increment accounted for, I was to test my endurance at 6 minutes before possibly adding more time if feasible. Notably, the difference between the lowest and current step wasn’t significantly palpable, allowing me to surpass 6 minutes without issue and extending to 7 minutes overall.

Following the sauna exit, tackling the challenge of the cold bath was imperative yet again. Believing unlikely death from it, this time I mustered courage into overcoming fear, striving to immerse straight up to my neck. Deliberately preventing submersion of my hands, I managed to endure for a succinct period. Having succeeded in flawlessly matching my friend's described etiquette by this third trial, there was confidence, with a hint of felicity that I eventually achieved what was previously unmet.

Though the 40 seconds were approximate based on feeling rather than strict timing, when we made to exit, it felt like the span hadn’t elapsed fully — though I inquired if I should remain longer. A sufficient period seemed discreetly established when my friend impatiently initiated the end. Paradoxically, I perceived personal resistance to prolonging my own endurement, contemplating if the novice outweighed the veteran in perseverance.

After exiting the cold bath, the emphasis on wiping off water was highlighted again. Although I somewhat dismissed this previously, I ensured thorough drying the third time. Contrary to prior rounds, I sat within the indoor area this time, resting on a chair. Eye-closing experiences supposedly helped "tuning," as my friend did; hence I followed suit.

Ultimately, discerning the true essence of "tuning" remained elusive throughout. Despite resembling my friend's depictions, whether it amounted to pleasure... it seemed insignificant, correlating more to sheer fatigue. This exhausted sensation was compounded by both the abrupt temperature fluctuation and mental relief upon completing the daunting session.

Reassurance came from my friend, who affirmed that due diligence to the given regimen and adequate duration was upheld. This assurance stood firm, being vouched by someone seasoned alongside. Yet, regrettably, the sauna’s allure escaped me. Conclusively, if anything, realizing "so that’s what to expect" ensured a gleaned understanding. This resulted in a verdict unlikely to repeat upon future invitations, especially with sustained anxiety about nakedness among others, which persisted subsequent to revisiting the onsen. The audacity to immerse shared baths absent appealing allurements, such as tranquilizing views, remains uneasy.

Much like observations shared by Hiroyuki, baring oneself before strangers, originally mortifying, yet indiscriminately normalized within particular settings like beaches or baths, denotes societal peculiarity. Aligning with this perspective, stripping for an onsen isn’t magically unembarrassing. Regardless of context, people are present; awkwardness hardly dissipates. Any visual delight potentially trounces modesty solely with assuaging company, which, arguably, seldom occurs given sparse occurrences and enduring shame despite enticing appearances.

Considering vacationing with friends, unique regional saunas might incidentally furnish worthwhile ventures. Nonetheless, driven motivations akin to past excursions remain absent.

It stands plausible why first dives yield unmet anticipations, parallel to unswayed inclinations. Just as with the current scenario, life often operates capriciously. That's the way the cookie crumbles.

Incidentally, penning this transpired after a week had passed, entailing lesser recollection and mild cooling of initial fervor — thus proving challenging to conclude. Truly, timely documentation, akin to striking the iron while it’s hot, remains unmatched.
