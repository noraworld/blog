### First Time Sauna Challenge
As I mentioned in [don't be afraid to try new things](sauna-challenge), I went to a sauna with a friend on June 26. This was my first sauna experience ever.

We went to Izumi Tenku no Yu at Haneda Airport. My friend told me it’s a high-end place. It was pretty pricey at 4,800 yen. It used to be in the 3,000-yen range, but I guess the increase in foreign tourists led to a price hike. I saw a few foreigners there, so maybe it's that, or it could be due to the rising costs.

### A Light Meal
We didn’t go to the sauna immediately. We first met in Shinagawa and had a light lunch. Since it's not a good idea to eat heavy meals before a sauna, we had takoyaki at the food court near Shinagawa Station.

My friend wanted to check out a steakhouse, but it only opens in the evening on weekdays. Even if it were open, eating steak before a sauna wouldn’t be sensible, so it was just a recon mission.

### Haneda Airport
We chatted a bit at the food court and then headed to Haneda Airport's Terminal 3 station. We took the Keikyu Main Line Limited Express, which goes directly there, making it easy.

Although we arrived at Haneda Airport, we didn’t go to the sauna right away. We strolled around the airport. Even though we weren’t flying anywhere, the airport is packed with facilities, so just exploring the shops was fun.

The Edo Alley was especially impressive. It had shops replicating the Edo period streetscape, giving it a nostalgic vibe. I wish I’d taken pictures.

### Izumi Tenku no Yu
After exploring Haneda Airport, we finally headed to Izumi Tenku no Yu. I was also curious about the fancy-looking hotel next to it, but this time, it was all about the sauna.

The facility was ordinary—nothing surprising. I hadn’t been to a hot spring for over 10 years, so it was about what I remembered. But since it’s inside Haneda Airport and the price is high, the exterior and interior were very nice.

To avoid dehydration from sweating, I bought some Pocari Sweat at the convenience store before heading to the onsen.

My friend joked about choosing locker numbers like “404 Not Found,” so I went with “403 Forbidden,” which made my friend laugh (a little nerd joke).

### Sauna Etiquette
Since my friend was used to saunas, they asked me to follow the etiquette:

1. Wash your body and soak in the hot spring.
2. Enter the sauna room and sweat for about 8 to 10 minutes.
3. Exit the sauna, rinse off the sweat, and soak in cold water for about 40 seconds.
4. Get out and dry off the water droplets.
5. Lie down or sit on a chair outside or in the bath area and rest for a while.
6. Repeat steps 2–5 two or three times.
7. Finally, soak in the hot spring again.

This is the general flow, but each phase has more details.

Firstly, the length of time in the sauna isn’t strictly defined, but about 8 to 10 minutes is recommended. Since it was my first time, my friend suggested starting with 6 minutes. Some people go for 12 minutes, but it should be without overdoing it.

Speed is crucial after leaving the sauna. You should quickly rinse and get into the cold water for maximum effect—a state known as “Totonou.” Since your hands have complex nerve endings, avoid putting them in the cold water; instead, submerge your body up to the neck—about 40 seconds.

Drying off the water is also essential because the droplets take away your body heat. Wiping thoroughly after getting out of the cold water is good practice.

We repeated this three times. Here’s what happened each time.

#### First Time
I started by washing my body and soaking in the hot spring. Since I had showered before leaving home, I just quickly rinsed off without using shampoo or body wash. The temperature varied by section, but this hot spring was about 37.5 degrees Celsius. Up to this point, it was like the experiences I had as a child.

Then, finally, I entered the sauna. There was a steam type, too, but we used the traditional sauna all three times. My friend isn’t a fan of steam. As soon as I stepped in, I felt a powerful wave of heat—not figurative, literal heat. Toward the back, it steps up, with the temperature rising as you go higher. The lowest level is 80 degrees, and according to my friend, the highest is 90 degrees. Since this was my first time, I started at the bottom. My friend sat one step above.

The sauna room was intimidating. The handle on the door felt like it could burn me, and the entire room was so hot that I felt enveloped in heat. I also found breathing a bit scary; inhaling made my nose hurt, and the air felt hard to draw in. Talking required more effort to breathe, so I spoke less. Holding a towel over my mouth helped, so I kept it there as much as possible.

I’d planned to do 6 minutes at first, but it wasn’t as challenging, so I extended to 7 minutes. After the sauna, I washed off the sweat.

Entering the cold water right after was the most challenging part. It's tough to immerse yourself in cold water, but even harder immediately after the sauna, where the contrast is intense. My friend went right in, up to the neck, but I had to take it slow due to the chill—and I accidentally submerged my hands in the water as well.

I managed to get in up to my chest, but the chill above was too much for me. To describe it precisely, I had a sense of panic that my heart might stop, so I didn’t try to immerse my head and neck this first time.

At last, I got out of the cold water and lay outside in the open-air bath, gazing at the sky for a while. I had a light sensation of drifting away. I was a bit sleep-deprived, and felt I might actually doze off—it was an odd sensation of fatigue, perhaps. Of course, I couldn’t stay asleep; I was a bit scared, so I kept my eyes open during the process.

This concluded my first attempt.

#### Second Time
Since repeating these steps two or three times is standard, we headed back to the sauna. By now, I got the hang of it, so my friend suggested we try for longer. We went for about 8 minutes this time, sticking to the lower 80-degree level for sweating.

I was still a bit scared to breathe deeply, but the heat didn’t bother me as much. My friend was having a tough time at the top level, but personally, the heat was fine for me. I thought maybe I was more resistant than expected. More time in the sauna doesn’t equate to better results, so after 8 minutes, we stepped out.

Then came the cold water again. I was cautious about not submerging my hands this time. My body reflexively could only go in gradually, but I was braver than the first time. Yet it still seemed like a chest-high depth was my limit.

Afterward, I didn’t lie down in the outer bath but sat on a chair and enjoyed the breeze for a while. Then I went into the indoor 37.5-degree hot spring to rest. Considering it was my first try, two rounds would have been enough, but I felt uncertain. Mainly because I wasn’t sure what “Totonou” was supposed to feel like. My friend described it as a rush of fatigue while resting on the chair after cold water, leading to a blank state of mind—an experience I somewhat had, but not to the extent where it was pleasurable. It just felt more like routine exhaustion. So I couldn’t understand why anyone would actively seek it out. I didn’t feel that it was something exceptional.

But I didn’t want sauna enthusiasts to claim I didn’t experience it right, saying I broke protocol or didn’t spend long enough. So I resolved to follow my friend’s instructions to the letter in the third round, despite wanting to avoid more discomfort. Still, such chances didn’t come often, so I pushed on, proposing the final round myself.

#### Third Time
In the third round, I fully committed to complete the routine properly. I discovered that once used to the sauna, it’s manageable enough, so with my friend’s encouragement, I tried a level higher, around 82.5 degrees, while my friend went even higher.

We started at 6 minutes, preparing to add another if it seemed doable. Honestly, the difference from the previous level wasn’t huge, so the 6 minutes weren’t too challenging; I added a minute to make it 7.

The moment came to challenge myself with the cold water—my biggest hurdle. Realistically, survival wasn’t a concern, so I gathered courage and decided to immerse myself up to the neck this time. I kept my hands out of the water, enduring it to completion. Successfully following my friend’s guidance this time, I felt certain no complaints could be had. It meant I also felt a sense of accomplishment from overcoming challenges unachieved in previous rounds.

The 40 seconds wasn’t precision-timed but estimated, yet leaving the water was suggested sooner than expected. Wondering aloud if 40 seconds passed, my friend reassured me it was enough and swiftly ended the session. Frankly, I thought I could tolerate a bit more. I felt notably tougher for a first-timer than expected, a strange pride in my perseverance.

Since drying off was emphasized, I was diligent about it after the cold water. Finally, I spent time in the indoor setting, observing my friend “Totonou” with their eyes closed and did likewise.

By the end, “Totonou” remained an ambiguous experience. I had similar sensations to my friend but couldn’t deem it enjoyable. Just physical weariness, like surviving an ordeal, and not intricate pleasure.

My friend assured me I followed the protocol sufficiently, ruling out missteps. So while some aspect I did experience lined up, the sensation wasn’t rewarding to me.

A final soak in the open-air bath followed. It was warmer than the indoors, around 40 degrees. The winds created surface waves outside. Even a slip of onsen water I got in my mouth was surprisingly salty, reminding me of its composition and who might bathed there.

### Chat Rest
After leaving the onsen, we sat in what looked like massage chairs but were really just reclining chairs, chatting as we watched the sun set.

![](https://noraworld.github.io/box-ivysaur/2025/07/07/57b3296eef7dd6d6fd009255e3133a65.jpg)

It turned to romance talks as my friend shared about someone they liked, and I talked about a person I met on a dating app and hung out with for lunch, gachapon, and a little shopping. My friend was intrigued by my potential girlfriend prospects, but I explained she felt more like a good friend than anything else.

My friend, too, had someone they liked but wasn’t close enough to reach the “girlfriend” stage. While they were messaging, I, without even that interaction range, was envious they seemed a step further ahead. My friend, somewhat exasperated, reminded me it wasn’t a done deal.

Any chance of a relationship brings pressure over messages or conversations; not knowing what to say or overthinking things can paralyze you into nonsense, they noted. It’s relatable; anyone captivated feels just as tense. It's like our brains downgrade to chimp level in those moments. I advised approaching it light-heartedly as if speaking to any friend, not over-analytical—though it’s not advice I personally find easy to follow.

Next door to the reclining chair area was a place for stone sauna; it seemed this onsen was well-equipped. Though the English instructions seemed a little off, adding to the charm.

### Dinner
Before we knew it, dusk arrived as we chatted in those chairs. Any time I meet this friend, we tend to stay until late, so we planned on having dinner together. However, delaying beyond a point might have meant closed restaurants. The onsen had a dining area, overpriced, touting uninspiring options, so we left to find another place. But with the onsen’s premium, entry alone was already a hefty 4,800 yen.

Although many places were closed for the night, some remained open. Foreign visitor-targeting eateries charged higher prices, but one offering Japanese seafood dishes was fairly reasonable, so we dined there.

My friend selected a mackerel set, and I opted for the salmon haras.

We exchanged bites; the mackerel was tastier, leaving me wishing I’d ordered it. Sure, it was bony and tricky to eat, though. And I debated white rice over brown rice. It’d been forever since I had brown rice; still not fond of it.

After dinner, we headed back to Shinagawa Station.

### Café
Around ten at night, feeling some things remained unsaid, we searched for a café near Shinagawa Station. It drizzled lightly outside. Luckily, we found Pronto open until 11, and headed in. Pronto can seem café-like, yet this spot had quite a serious menu, and arriving that near closing did get some stares. That’s typical in dining, though.

There, we continued our conversation over drinks. Relationship topics lingered. Usually covering tech, crypto, or finance, today was all about love. We hadn't seriously pursued relationships before, but desire to find someone special strengthened with age; my friend, with several previous partners, could manage but I hadn’t, causing a buildup of longing.

Despite a wish to relax and linger in conversation, closing time forced us out. We strolled, hovered, questioning our wandering, then parted ways eventually. Shinagawa being close enough to walk home seemed nice after a full day, for reflection, but given the rain, the train was the choice this time.

### Impressions
I’ve always been firmly against exposing myself around others; as a child, forced onsen visits during family trips were my interactions. As an adult, a newfound personal choice meant avoiding it—and invitations were rare. It’s been so long I’ve even forgotten when I last visited a hot spring—could be nearly 20 years.

Repeated sauna praise and invites from my friend couldn’t sway me. Citing my discomfort with nudity helped dissuade them. But despite seeming resignation, repeated asks came, each making me consider this might be my sole chance to try. A strong bond with my friend urged me not to waste an opportunity, fearing it might be a loss in life. Reluctance persisted until visiting, but curiosity outweighed.

Ultimately, I didn’t find the sauna as appealing, but it was an insightful, learning process. Understanding its nature suffices. Despite conclusion leaning against another visit soon—it lingers unwanted, the notion of public nudity not dissolving. Even at Haneda Airport’s high-class Izumi Tenku no Yu, discomfort remained. The idea of a broader public bath elevating discomfort is easy to imagine.

Hiroyuki once noted the peculiar ease people find in exposing themselves at beaches or onsens, like a complicit mass insanity. This resonates; onsen shouldn’t lessen any embarrassment. With exceptions for open-minded beauties, who’d have such company? Even in mixed baths, faint shame remains, dissuading soaking desires.

Future group trip chit-chat involved sauna consideration of local offerings as possibility but not primary goal. Exploring novel places is interesting, if, maybe, but goal-centric visits wouldn’t appeal to me.

Expectations unmet or a correct prediction of reluctance defines first-time experiences. Aligning exactly—much like this time. Such things happen, marking the course of life. That's the way the cookie crumbles.

Incidentally, writing this over a week later, some specifics have faded as enthusiasm cooled, making completion a challenge. Precision in timing offers better results—striking while the iron is hot.
