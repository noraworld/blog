### First Sauna Challenge
As I mentioned in [Avoiding New Experiences Narrows Your Horizons](sauna-challenge), I visited a sauna with a friend on June 26. This was my first time experiencing a sauna.

We went to the Izumi Tenku no Yu at Haneda Airport. According to my friend, the hot springs and sauna at Haneda are considered quite high-end. Indeed, the cost was a hefty 4,800 yen. I heard it used to be in the 3,000 yen range but probably increased due to a rise in foreign tourists. Indeed, I saw several foreigners there. Alternatively, it might be the result of cost increases due to rising prices.

### Light Meal
We didn't head straight to the sauna. We first met in Shinagawa for a light lunch, thinking a light meal would be better before the hot springs and sauna. We had takoyaki at a food court around Shinagawa Station.

My friend mentioned wanting to visit a steakhouse, but it seems they only operate in the evenings on weekdays. Even if they were open, it would have been merely reconnaissance, as eating steak right before heading to a hot spring and sauna isn't feasible.

### Haneda Airport
After some casual chat at the food court, we left Shinagawa and headed to Haneda Airport Terminal 3 Station. It was convenient as we could get there directly on the Keikyu Main Line Rapid Express.

Even upon arriving at Haneda Airport, we didn’t go straight to the sauna but rather wandered around the airport premises. Although we didn’t intend to board a plane, the airport had various facilities, and just exploring the commercial areas was intriguing.

The Edo Koji area left a strong impression—it was atmospheric, with stores lining the street in an Edo period townscape style. I wish I had taken pictures.

### Izumi Tenku no Yu
After wandering around Haneda Airport, we finally headed to Izumi Tenku no Yu. Personally, I was curious about the seemingly luxurious hotel attached to it, but this time it was all about Izumi Tenku no Yu.

The facility was not particularly surprising—typical, in a sense. I hadn’t been to a hot spring in over ten years, but it was reminiscent of my past experiences. Located inside Haneda Airport and given its high price, the exterior and interior were quite pristine.

To avoid dehydration from sweating profusely, I bought a Pocari Sweat from a convenience store before heading into the hot spring.

Our friend joked about using "404 Not Found" for their locker, so I said I'd use "403 Forbidden," which made them laugh (a joke for engineers).

### Sauna Etiquette
My friend, accustomed to saunas, instructed me to follow proper etiquette. Here's the procedure:

1. Wash your body first and soak in the hot spring
2. Enter the sauna room and sweat for about 8 to 10 minutes
3. Exit the sauna room, rinse off sweat with a bucket shower, then soak in cold water for about 40 seconds
4. Exit the cold water and wipe off water droplets from your body
5. Rest for a while lying down or sitting on a chair outside or in the bathroom
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 about 2 to 3 times
7. Finish by soaking in the hot spring again

This is the overall flow, but each phase has further detailed etiquette.

Regarding the time spent in the sauna room, there's no specific rule, but approximately 8 to 10 minutes is recommended. Since it was my first time, I was advised to start with about 6 minutes. Some people stay for about 12 minutes, but it depends on your comfort level.

Speed is crucial when exiting the sauna room. It’s said to be more effective to quickly rinse off sweat after exiting and then soak in cold water. This phenomenon is often referred to as "tuning." Since nerve endings are concentrated in the hands, it’s better to immerse your whole body up to your neck without putting your hands in the cold water for about 40 seconds.

Wiping off water droplets afterward is also important. As heat is drawn from water droplets, it is beneficial to thoroughly wipe your body after exiting the cold water.

We repeated this procedure three times. Here's what each session entailed:

#### First Session
First, I washed my body and soaked in the hot spring. Since I had showered before leaving home, I didn’t use shampoo or body soap, just rinsed off lightly. The large bath had varying temperatures for each section, and I soaked in one that was about 37.5 degrees. Although it's been ages since I last visited a hot spring, this part was something I had experienced in childhood.

Then, I finally entered the sauna room. Although there was a steam type, I chose to go with the bathing style all three times. My friend doesn’t seem to prefer the steam type. Upon entering the sauna room, the heat was tremendous. Literally, a physical sensation of heat. Sitting places inside the room were organized in a tiered manner, increasing in temperature the higher up you went. The lowest was 80 degrees, and my friend said the highest was 90 degrees. There were five levels, so ascending one level raises the temperature by approximately 2.5 degrees. Since it was my first experience, I started on the lowest level. My friend went up one level.

There was a slight sense of fear in the sauna room. The doorknob seemed to burn at the touch, and the room’s temperature enveloped the body in blazing heat. Breathing felt a bit scary. Taking a breath slightly hurt my nasal cavity, and there was some fear in inhaling deeply. I couldn’t talk much, as speaking required deeper breaths. Covering my mouth with a towel mitigated it a bit, so I kept a towel over my mouth once I figured it out.

Initially, I intended to stay for 6 minutes, but feeling surprisingly okay, I added another minute to make it 7 minutes. Then, I exited the sauna room and rinsed off the sweat with the bucket shower.

The biggest challenge followed: immersing in cold water immediately after. It’s tough to soak in cold water even without the sauna, and doing so right after heightens the difficulty due to the extreme temperature difference. My friend plunged in up to their neck swiftly, but the coldness forced me to enter gradually. Distracted by the cold water, I accidentally submerged my hand as well.

I managed to dip up to the chest but found it too cold to reach the neck. To be precise, it felt like I could do it with immense perseverance, but the physical strain made it hard to breathe, inciting fear of a heart attack, so I refrained from going neck-deep the first time.

Once out of the cold bath, I moved to the outdoor area, lay down on a chair looking at the sky, and zoned out. It felt like my consciousness was drifting away. Already feeling sleep-deprived, I almost dozed off, registering a sense of fatigue. Knowing I couldn’t sleep, I kept my eyes open due to slight fear during that duration.

Thus ended the first session.

#### Second Session
With the plan to repeat the process 2 to 3 times, I re-entered the sauna room. Understanding the drill from the first session, my friend suggested staying longer this time, so I spent about 8 minutes inside the second time. Again, I sweated on the lowest level at 80 degrees.

Despite still feeling apprehensive about deep breathing, the temperature became more bearable. While my friend on the top level seemed to struggle with the 8 minutes, I found the heat tolerable. It seems I might endure heat better than expected. However, longer isn’t necessarily better, so we ended it at 8 minutes.

Following the same process, I immersed myself in cold water. Earlier, I mistakenly dunked my hand, so I was more careful this time to avoid that. My body was still resistant to plunging neck-deep due to fear but felt a little more ready for it in the second attempt. Nevertheless, breathing difficulties and fear stopped me midway in my attempt to go deeper.

Then, I went back to the outdoor area, sat on a chair instead of lying down, and let the breeze wash over for some time. Later, I returned indoors to the initial 37.5-degree hot spring and relaxed away.

Given it was my first experience, my friend mentioned doing just 2 sessions would be sufficient. I felt somewhat unfulfilled, uncertain about whether I did achieve the "tuning" state properly. My friend mentioned that during the resting phase, the overwhelming fatigue where you just blank out felt synonymous with "tuning," and while I experienced something similar, it didn’t quite feel pleasant. Rather than enjoyable, it felt more like a sense of relief from arduous work, not making me eager to relive it simply for that sensation.

I didn’t want those praising sauna experiences to say, "You didn’t follow the procedure right," hence wanted to perform another round obeying my friend's guidance perfectly. Despite not feeling the pleasantness, enduring it just felt like a bothersome task, making me consider giving up at this point. However, realizing this might be the last chance, my reluctance faded, convincing me to propose undertaking a third trial.

#### Third Session
I resolved to endure and execute the third session correctly. With sauna acclimation rendering it less grueling, I accepted my friend’s suggestion to move up one tier. It’s probably around 82.5 degrees this time, with my friend advancing to about 85 degrees.

Starting anew with slightly increased difficulty, we opted for 6 minutes, testing waters, potentially extending if tolerable. The marginal distinction between the lowest and this tier didn’t hinder completion of 6 minutes, adding a minute, making it a total of 7 minutes.

Then, confronting the most challenging cold-water immersion for the third time. I thought survival probable, thus shedding my previously crippling fear, braving a neck-deep plunge this time. Successfully keeping my hands out of the water, I managed to endure. Achieving my friend’s explained procedure unerringly, I reveled in this newfound confidence, closing in on something previously unattainable in rounds 1 and 2.

The accuracy of the 40 seconds measure was iffy, based on haphazard estimate rather than clockwork precision. But feeling the all-clear to exit felt perpetual, prompting verification from my friend, marking completion. The third session saw me surpass expected endurance, somewhat claiming superior perseverance in this inaugural trial.

Upon cold water exit, meticulous removal of water droplets emerged crucial, having skimmed over it lazily in initials rounds, diligently achieved in the third. Rather than outside later, I rested indoors on a chair, indulging in solitude. Posing open-ended dialogue received silence in return; a check led to finding my friend lost in "tuning" with eyes closed, compelling companionship. 

Ultimately, deciphering “tuning” eluded me. Similar feelings to the shared experience were palpable, yet whether it stood as euphoric remained questionable, presenting itself more as fatigue. Physical strain from temperature shifts and mental exhaustion from completing tedious tasks seemed more prominent.

Encouraging remarks reaffirmed adherence accuracy, signaling no erroneous practices or inadequate duration. My friend’s credibility assured correctness, yet unable to relish sauna, it fell as a point of “so that’s what this is.” Enriching experience, yet probable dismissal of future sauna endeavors prevails. Discomfort aside, initial deterrence of communal nudity resurfaced. Not just exposure, but unappealing accompanying characters magnified dissatisfaction. If Sento premium failed to appease, majority-driven onsens exacerbate it undeniably.

Similar musings from Hiroyuki solidify the peculiar societal leniency towards public undress on beaches/onsens clashing with conventional modesty. Almost deemed normalized insanity. Despite environmental shifts towards acceptable nudity, inherent apprehension resists eradication. Should provocatively open-minded beauties errupt the scene, potential ocular victories could outweigh shame, yet those occurrences scarce. Otherwise, electromagnetic interest remains lukewarm.

Talking about traveling jointly surfaced at one point; if new regional hot springs feature on-location, participation aligns with exploration. Otherwise, sans incentivizing chiaroscuro, alternate intentions dissipate anticipation akin to the current ordeal.

Not all debut ventures align with expectations sometimes; oft predictably tedious. A life’s reality! That's the way the cookie crumbles.

Additionally, filling this post a week past the actual occurrence proved challenging due to dissipated enthusiasm, making completion laborious. Freshness is key to content expulsion—truly, strike while the iron is hot.
