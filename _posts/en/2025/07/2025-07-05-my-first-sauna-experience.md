### First Sauna Challenge
As written in [Don't Judge Things Without Trying](sauna-challenge), I went to a sauna with a friend on June 26, so here’s a summary of that time. This was my first sauna experience ever.

The place we went to was Izumi Tenkunoyu at Haneda Airport. According to my friend, the hot springs and sauna at Haneda Airport are pretty high-end. Indeed, the price was quite high at 4,800 yen. I heard it used to be around 3,000 yen, but maybe prices went up due to the increase in foreign tourists or it could be due to rising costs.

### Light Meal
We didn't head straight to the sauna; first, we met up in Shinagawa and had a light lunch. Since it’s better to eat lightly before a hot spring or sauna, we had takoyaki at a food court near Shinagawa Station.

My friend mentioned wanting to try a steakhouse, but it only opens at night on weekdays. Even if it had been open, a steak before a sauna isn’t ideal, so it was just a casual look around.

### Haneda Airport
After some light chatting at the food court, we left Shinagawa and headed to Haneda Airport Terminal 3 Station. It was easy as we could take the Keikyu Main Line express directly.

Even after arriving at Haneda Airport, we didn’t rush to the sauna. Instead, we wandered around the airport, which is interesting due to the various facilities. Just browsing the shopping areas was fun.

Edo Koji left a strong impression. It had shops lined up that mimicked the townscape of the Edo period; it was quite charming. I regret not taking any photos.

### Izumi Tenkunoyu
After exploring Haneda Airport for a bit, we finally headed to Izumi Tenkunoyu. Personally, I was intrigued by the seemingly luxurious hotel next door, but our destination was Izumi Tenkunoyu this time.

The facility was generally ordinary, with nothing particularly surprising. It’s been over 10 years since I last hit a hot spring, and it felt familiar. Since it's inside Haneda Airport and quite pricy, the exterior and interior were clean and nice.

To avoid dehydration after sweating a lot, I bought a sports drink at a convenience store before hitting the hot spring.

At the shoe locker, my friend jokingly suggested setting it to "404 Not Found", so I laughed and said I'd set mine to "403 Forbidden" (an engineer joke).

### Sauna Etiquette
Since my friend is used to saunas, they asked me to follow the proper etiquette. Here’s what it involves:

1. First, wash your body and soak in the hot spring.
2. Enter the sauna room and sweat for about 8-10 minutes.
3. Exit the sauna, rinse off the sweat with warm water, and then soak in cold water for about 40 seconds.
4. Get out of the cold water and wipe off the water droplets.
5. Lie down or sit in a chair outside or in the bathroom to rest for a bit.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 two to three times.
7. Finally, soak in the hot spring again.

That’s the flow, but there are more detailed etiquettes for each phase.

First, there isn't a strict specification for how long to stay in the sauna room, but generally, around 8-10 minutes is ideal. Since this was my first time, my friend suggested starting with around 6 minutes. Some people even stay for 12 minutes, but make sure to do what feels right for you.

It’s important to move quickly after leaving the sauna. Rinsing off the sweat and immediately soaking in cold water is said to enhance the effect, known as "tuning". The nervous system is concentrated in the hands, so don’t put your hands in the cold water; instead, submerge your entire body up to the neck for about 40 seconds.

Wiping off the water droplets from your body is important too. The droplets can steal your body heat, so it’s good to dry your body thoroughly after getting out of the cold water.

We repeated this process three times. Here’s what I experienced during each round.

#### Round 1
First, I washed my body and soaked in the hot spring. Since I had taken a shower before leaving home, I didn’t use shampoo or body soap in the hot spring, just rinsed off some sweat lightly. Different sections of the wide bathhouse had different temperatures, so I entered one around 37.5 degrees. Though a hot spring visit was rare for me since childhood, this part felt familiar.

Then, finally, I entered the sauna room. There was a steam type, but I opted for the regular bath one all three times. My friend isn’t fond of steam types. Entering the sauna room instantly exposed me to intense heat. Moving further inside, I found a seating area structured like steps, where higher levels mean higher temperatures. The lowest level was 80 degrees, and the highest, according to my friend, was around 90 degrees. There were five levels, so each level was about 2.5 degrees hotter. Since it was my first time, I started at the lowest level, while my friend sat on the level above me.

The sauna room felt somewhat intimidating. The door handle seemed like it would burn you if touched, and the room’s overall temperature felt like it could sear through you. Breathing deeply was a bit scary as inhaling slightly hurt my nasal passage. Breathing in that air felt challenging, and inhaling deeply was nerve-wracking. Speaking required extra breaths, which wasn’t feasible, so I rarely spoke. Placing a towel near my face eased inhaling, so I mostly held a towel to my mouth.

Initially, I planned to exit after 6 minutes, but since I felt okay, I stayed for an extra minute, totaling 7 minutes. Afterward, I exited the sauna and rinsed off my sweat.

Then came the toughest part, immediately plunging into cold water. Entering cold water is challenging without the sauna beforehand, and the dramatic temperature difference post-sauna was hard to handle. My friend plunged in up to their neck in one go, but it was so cold that I could only enter gradually. Distracted by the cold, I accidentally submerged my hands.

I managed to immerse myself up to my chest, but the cold was fearfully intense, and I hesitated to submerge up to my neck. There was a sense of dread that if I pushed further, the cold shock might induce a heart attack; therefore, during the first round, I couldn't immerse my neck.

Leaving the cold bath, I went to the outdoor section and lay down on a chair, gazing at the sky while zoning out. It felt like my consciousness was fading. Being sleep-deprived made me feel as if I could fall asleep instantly, a sensation akin to fatigue. Though, obviously, I couldn’t let myself doze off; a slight fear kept me alert with eyes open.

This concluded the first round.

#### Round 2
We planned to repeat the cycle two to three times, so we returned to the sauna room. Having grasped the feel of it during the first session, my friend suggested attempting a longer stay this round. So, we decided on an 8-minute session this time. Again, I chose the lowest 80-degree spot to sweat it out.

Deep breathing remained daunting, but I started getting accustomed to the heat. My friend, being positioned at the highest spot, seemed quite challenged during the 8-minute stay, whereas I was relatively unfazed by the heat. Apparently, I might be more tolerant of just the heat than I thought. Though tempted to linger longer, my friend appeared strained, and more time didn’t equate to better, signaling time to wrap up at 8 minutes.

Once again, I plunged into the cold water. Last time I accidentally submerged my hands, so I was careful this time. The body naturally recoiled from the temperature shock, and submerging up to my neck in one go invoked fear, so I eased in. Compared to the first round, I felt braver in immersing; however, breathing difficulties surfaced near chest-level immersion. I emerged shortly afterward.

Afterward, I returned outside to the open-air area but this time sat on a chair, allowing the breeze to cool me. Then, I rested in an indoor spring, the one I initially entered at approximately 37.5 degrees. The friend mentioned my inexperience, emphasizing that even two rounds sufficed, but I felt unsatisfied. Mostly because I couldn't attest to whether I’d experienced the touted “tuning” effect. My friend relayed that the lethargy accompanied by overwhelming fatigue post-cold bath is the “tuning” exhilaration. I felt something akin to it, though it didn’t seem as pleasant or fascinating—a mere struggle completing, partially enjoyable, was how it struck me.

Despite assurances that my technique and time weren’t at fault, likely wouldn’t align with enthusiasts arguing for error, so I decided on committing to a third round precisely adhering to friends’ instructions. If I halted, possibly never venturing into a sauna again, especially unaccompanied. Thus, I motioned for the final attempt.

#### Round 3
With resolve, I embarked on the third run aiming for precision as instructed by a friend. By now, the sauna itself wasn’t daunting; on suggestion, I moved up a level for a mild challenge, probably around 82.5 degrees. My friend attempted the next level, approximately 85 degrees.

For round three, I initially aimed to endure 6 minutes. If feasible, add a minute. Not noticeably different from the previous level, 6 minutes passed comfortably, prompting the addition staged 7th minute entry.

Emerging from the sauna, the cold bath awaited, yet I intended to dispel fear and endure neck-immersing without hesitation—success achieved. Crucially, I remembered to keep hands out of the water, holding the position steadily, achieving an unprecedented outcome in my third trial.

Approximately 40 seconds wasn’t precisely timed, but the gut feeling said it was time, awaiting a friend's signal who suggested wrapping soon. Questioning brief duration, the friend's assurance signaled closure, though I cautiously perceived longer resilience than assumed, acquiring a sense of achievement for overcoming previous failures on the third attempt.

Surpassing challenges, my friend's validation assured correctness in my method, confirming adeptness albeit absent the rapture in the experiences. From muster surpassing previous obstacles, I found satisfaction even if the experience felt mundane—a token experience regardless.

Lastly, resting in an open-air hot bath, warmer indoors, set at around 40 degrees. Outside, gusty winds churned the surface. Instinctively a splash entered my mouth, startling by its saltiness. Presumably, the taste related to hot spring elements, although the presence of other gentlemen prompted repulsion.

### Love Talks Break
Post-bath leisure lingered in what appeared like a massage chair, but was an accommodating recliner, watching sunsets with a friend engaging in conversation.

My friend opened about a newfound crush, prompting me to reciprocate with tales of recent chats and shared lunches with someone met through a dating app. Our shared activities bonded us, yet I hesitated romantically categorizing it, preferring a friendship stance.

Curious, the friend pried whether she qualified as a girlfriend, yet affections felt platonic, conveying a comfortable companion vibe instead of romantic allure.

Concerned with mutual comfort and trust in relationships, we ventured discussions frequently, anticipating genuine connections. Despite a mutual lack of past efforts in dating, the yearning for companionship had grown earnest this time. Historically, friends secured a few partners yet remained cautious about labeling current dynamics prematurely.

Flirting loomed serious, as exchanges felt riveting yet verbose tension stiffened interaction, deteriorating articulate wit. Struggling conversationally with ardent subjects, stumbling over idioms crossed familiarity, sympathizing in mutual understanding, reinforcing assurances of lightness and suggesting conversational relatability.

Nestled adjacent to our resting place was a corner featuring hot stone baths, amplifying the resort's amenities, albeit suspect phrasing in adjacent cautions.

### Dinner
Time escaped unnoticed till sunset, habitual late gatherings facilitated shared dinners typically. Delaying too close to closing spawned risks; hence, discerning outside options beyond the sole resort offering, which marked high prices without appealing selections.

Venturing beyond, lowered shutters hinted closing, yet some places maintained operations. Despite airport pricing trends, a reasonably priced fish-centered dining appealed to us.

Opting for set meals, my friend picked mackerel, while I chose salmon belly.

Curious about each other's plates, a swap unveiled preference for mackerel, minor regrets sparked over choice, albeit bony handling. Long avoided brown rice imparted mild aversions, pondering white rice as preferable.

Post-supper departure led us toward Shinagawa Station's direction.

### Café
At about 10 PM, chat pursuits hadn’t dwindled, prompting a cafe hunt near Shinagawa Station. Rain pitter-pattered softly outside. Discovering a café called Pronto operational till 11 PM, we slipped in. Predicted as a casual café, it displayed an unexpectedly expansive menu. Especially nearing closing, orders a mere hour to close depicted possible scrutiny owing to meal intensities—not unusual in dining practices.

Settling amidst beverages, we mulled over relationships. Typically, aspiring discussions steer toward technical cultures—crypto or investment notions, entrained in high-minded realms. Nevertheless, nurturing plain love stories echoed relevance within bonds; recent musings revealed latent desires for partners.

Despite the ticking clock tightening leisurely talks, explorations swept broadly. Surveying friendships amid romantic vistas marked a pivotal conversation, yet inevitable departure beckoned as their closing hour approached, triggering exit and brief station wanderings until dispersal directions finalized departure contemplation. Opting trains under light rainfall suited regimented reflections post-shared outings.

### Reflections
Throughout childhood, public nudity incited formidable aversion, reluctantly indulged into familial hot spring outings yet abstained post-adulthood. Invitations toward such venues lacked throughout, my last visit veiled beyond two decades potentially. Friendly instigations heralded sauna praises continuously, yet nailed reluctance repetitively. Over time, inquisitively constant calls echoed echoing hopes for shared gatherings, indicating unexplored pathways potentially hindered personal horizons otherwise ripe for broader life spectrums.

Alteration amid hospitality and reluctance marked personal observation, clarifying uninspired demeanor paired curious endeavor with paradoxical expectancy fear inherently sourced. Shroud-shrouded satisfaction guarded, reassuring grasp eluding though guiding acknowledgment paved experiential yield moderately.

Pragmatic reflections attest gratuite exposure seldom yielding immediate immersion into fervor, yet underscored culmination into profound attested mnemonic relics reminding broader inanimate ere chances eluded sustained closure even reluctant. While a receding tide intuitively elicits denial subsequent invites, future endures untouched if subjective curiosity holds sway, impurities resist fostering readiness eagerly nurtured.

Adjusted preferences impact realizations, consolidated nudity discourse. Relaxation inability remaining unchecked amid social situational specificity, synchronized with familial assertions yielding intrinsic shame amid occasional juxtaposed public liberty clashing normative disconcerting standards rightly catalyzing divergent grandeur exclusive solitudes dream-induced.

Should leisure spot explorations beyond beckon intersectional incentive meanwhile garnering pleasurable delimitations warranted travel-bound, delighted preliminary avenues mutely augur prosperous adjacencies cautiously linger, conscience seats circumspect.

In seasoned portrayals, novelty orbiting satisfaction wanes, encapsulates prime instances malleable to perceptions yielding candid closures opposing anticipated grandeur. At a glance, the adventure's essence dawns resolutely, embedding iterative cross-referencing distinctly poised within memoir's grasp.

Note, this entry emerges a short interval past from inception, blogging warmth dimly muted in passage. Centered chronicles impress like fervor aflame, resonating deeply once essence immerses the reader in tangible resonating cognitions.
