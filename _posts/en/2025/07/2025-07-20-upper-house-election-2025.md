### Introduction
As the title suggests, I participated in the House of Councillors election held on July 20, 2025, and cast my vote. I voted around 9:30 in the morning. I'm writing this article after coming home (after also going for a walk and stopping by a supermarket), and publishing it the next day. Allegedly, [disclosing who you voted for while votes are still being accepted isn't considered electioneering if it doesn't amount to campaigning](https://chatgpt.com/share/687b60e0-d8f4-8004-ab7a-08bd07e7d96c), but since ChatGPT might not always be correct and I'm not an expert in election law, I’m playing it safe just in case.

### My First Time Voting
Actually, this was my first time going to an election. Honestly, I wasn’t very eager about voting in the past. It’s a common sentiment among young people in Japan because we often think nothing much will change even if we do vote. In a society of 120 million people, one person doesn’t hold much sway, and Japan's aging society means more elderly votes than those from young people. Consequently, politicians tend to favor policies that appeal to older voters for popularity. As a young person, I felt that my vote wouldn’t make any difference, and changes that would benefit young people would be unlikely to happen.

However, my perspective hasn’t completely changed, but the prevalence of political discussions online, particularly on YouTube, made political topics more accessible, gradually sparking my interest. Additionally, I grew increasingly frustrated with how globalism and left-wing ideals were dominating, which seemed alarming. Even if the ruling coalition, led likely by LDP and Komeito, retains power (as it probably will this time too), we could, potentially, turn them into a minority coalition, or at least weaken LDP’s vote bank. The impact of the Democratic Party for the People gaining significant influence last year also encouraged me.

I actually wanted to participate in [last year’s House of Representatives election](https://www.nhk.or.jp/senkyo/database/shugiin/), and would have likely voted for the Democratic Party for the People, but I happened to be returning from Australia on the day of the election and couldn’t vote. So, this was my first vote. It might be surprising for people in countries where elections are actively encouraged, or even mandatory, but in Japan, my situation wasn’t unique; turnout is around 50%, so many people never showed up either. Low voter turnout is indicative of failed education regarding civic duties.

### My Votes
Now, let’s get into who I voted for. I chose to write the name of an individual in the proportional representation section. According to YouTube, this influence goes to both the party and the individual candidate, which is a good deal.

|       | Candidate Name | Party          |
| :---: | :------------: | :------------: |
| [Electoral District (Tokyo)](https://www.nhk.or.jp/senkyo/database/sangiin/13/) | Eiji Kosaka     | Japan Conservative Party |
| Proportional Representation | Haruo Kitamura | Japan Conservative Party |

As for the party, I chose the [Japan Conservative Party](https://hoshuto.jp/). I sympathized with this party’s policies, so I thought I could write the party name for the proportional representation too. However, after doing some research on candidates, I discovered that [Haruo Kitamura, a well-known lawyer, was running for this party](https://www.nhk.or.jp/senkyo/database/sangiin/00/hmb12_245.html). 

At that moment, I hadn’t watched much of Kitamura's campaign speeches. Initially, I thought Ami Tomoka, who regularly appears on AbemaTV and seems sensible, could be a good candidate to support. Still, after watching Kitamura’s video, I concluded he was the most trustworthy among them, and I decided to vote for him. I’ve watched Kitamura’s videos on politics before and always found him logical and helpful. 

I didn’t know Kitamura was running with the Japan Conservative Party until I checked their candidate list. My decision to support the Conservative Party became more firm after learning Kitamura was on their side.

However, I felt a bit uneasy about the party's leader, Mr. Hyakuta. Although he didn’t say anything suspicious, his disparaging comments about the supporters of another party felt off-putting. I understand he can be expressive, but there’s a difference between a public official’s words and a private citizen’s. While I support their party policies, anyone scrutinizing the leader’s remarks could damage its image. So this aspect felt like a disadvantage. But my overall opinion didn't change significantly, although I refrained from writing his name personally.

### Sanseito vs. Conservative Party
Most of my research was done via YouTube. I actually started diving into election information about two days prior to the event. I had thought about voting, but didn’t feel determined until the last minute. I had been consuming political content on YouTube over time, though. 

The party that gained significant traction this time around was Sanseito. Before exploring this election’s details, I assumed the Democratic Party for the People would maintain its significant position as an influential opposition party. But the tides turned swiftly, much to my surprise. On further inspection, former Democratic Party groups Shifure and Shigol were ideologically leaning left, making their shift unsurprising.

Then emerged both Sanseito and the Japan Conservative Party. Sanseito notably swelled its support base, capturing attention across varying political divides, including the Democratic Party for the People’s and other parties’ supporters. The Japan Conservative Party, however, being in its early stages, with less than two years since inception, struggled with recognition. With about five years under its belt, Sanseito had the advantage there.

Learning about another party becoming popular took me by surprise, but the reasoning became evident soon. Both parties vocalize nationalist and right-wing ideologies, indicating backlash against the globalization-favoring ruling coalition of LDP and Komeito.

My party choices quickly boiled down to these two. Initial explorations of neutral opinions about both parties left me undecided. However, further inquiry revealed Sanseito leaned not particularly conservative, despite using a headline-catching slogan like "Japan First," which criticizes unchecked foreigner problems as a focus. 

While their stance on foreigner issues felt agreeable, upon researching further, Sanseito’s viewpoints diverged significantly from conservative thought. They endorse female emperors in practice, praise former Prime Minister Ishiba’s China-policy attitude, among other concerns. The former, supposedly just Mr. Kamiya’s (the party leader) opinion, conflicted with the party’s perceived united stance, thereby raising distrust. National topics like this demand solidarity within the party, else it risks wavering credibility.

Moreover, underlying factors, like conspiracy theories, insular leadership, or dubious backgrounds brought apprehension toward Sanseito.

Conversely, despite media portrayals, the Japan Conservative Party seemed aligned in goals. They held predetermined defensive policy actions against China and aimed to conserve traditional cultural values. My research concluded this as the primary party resonating with my beliefs. Though this view resonates at present, the future might reveal different outcomes; at the moment, they appear the most viable.

### The Rise of Conservative Politics
The policies proposed by the Japan Conservative Party echo those of emerging conservative factions globally, according to Ami Tomoka. Indeed, through briefs, it's apparent. Various Western countries see similar shifts - right now, Republican in the US, Reform Party in the UK, and Alternative for Germany, among others. Additionally, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán garner localized support, driven by grievances against globalization and immigration policies.

In Japan, discussions regarding female emperors, separate surnames, and the like surface frequently, while the Conservative Party stands firmly against such changes, asserting traditionalist positions. These definitive standpoints bolster their namesake’s credibility. Actually, it's surprising no other party boldly declares such clear-cut views (are there any...?). For instance, even not-yet-together factions can’t match the Conservative Party’s conclusive stance.

On foreign relations, the Conservative Party proposes straightforward measures, avoiding pandering typically spun as discrimination by left-leaning media. Discussing critical defense issues is crucial; hence, their firm answers on Article 9 revisions substantiate their promises. Furthermore, comments from Kitamura (now “Kitamura Lawyer”), on the National Defense Mobilization Law, indicate their resolute China-policy stands.

Meanwhile, Sanseito leader Kamiya envisions a future without US troops in Japan, while another party member addresses nuclear armament discussions. Although sensitive and requiring careful assessment, these topics at least need discourse and open dialogue.

Ultimately, the Conservative Party's ethos aligns with traditional conservatism, as evidenced by declared policies, dialogues, and overall direction. Internally, adhering to its promises fosters public assurance, avoiding appeasement, standing up to China, and considering national tradition preservation and law-abiding foreign protocol. No other ideology fits seamlessly, thus ensuring my support.

### Economic Policy
Frankly speaking, economic policy didn't weigh heavily on my decision-making. Although not dismissing its importance, I claim almost sheer ignorance.

Certain tangible political issues may lend themselves to lay interpretation. Still, economic policy intricacies breed varying expert opinions, so self-assured stances on economics escape many, including myself. Indeed, many Japanese appear inclined towards tax cuts, exasperated after stagnant decades. The correlation between taxation and economic stagnation seems logical; however, how much should be cut remains subjective.

Even if extensive cuts thrill citizens short-term, potential long-run disparities take caution. American examples attest. Thus, forgoing outright presumptions on economic fixes, considering ideological and national concerns better guide political mismatches. Mostly, I unfocused economic policies since many parties championed respective alternatives. Thus, politics remained my priority judgment.

### Summary
Certainly, everything’s not resolved. This Japan Conservative Party, just shy of two years since inception, lacks comprehensive support. Comparisons see them trailing the seemingly similar Sanseito, even though fundamental differences arise on further examination.

Internal disputes reportedly plague the party, a hinderance amidst recruiting. Despite unknown specifics, unity should top priorities; settling leadership quarrels is necessary. Outnumbered currently, dependence on coalition with established parties or facing adversarial stances appears inevitable.

Yet, the present Japanese sociopolitical climate, swayed considerably by globalization and leftism, signals significant nation crises. Although unrealistic for the election to overhaul dynamics fully, I hope supported candidates gain as many seats possible. Being instrumental in ushering transformation offers optimism, marking initial steps towards a positively redefined Japan.

### Afterthoughts
Remarkably, I had not slept a wink from the day before the election to the day of. Initially intending to rest well before heading out, I found myself ceaselessly absorbing pre-election content via YouTube. Videos consumed interest, and soon day broke. Once YouTube restricted early morning access, I promptly voted, ensuring decision clarity over dozing last-minute panic.

Arriving approximately around 9:30 at a school gym nearby, the procedure proved unexpectedly and reassuringly straightforward. New to polling experiences, I liken election simplicity to accessible civic engagement, requiring only home-received entry tickets.

Advanced voting involves filling back-of-ticket sections, but polling-day requires nothing preemptive. Going through stages of district ballots followed by proportional representation efficiently concluded without delays.

Finishing was surprisingly quick; I strolled in contemplative thought afterwards. A quick grocery stop preceded returning home.

Now, sleep-deprived, I eagerly anticipate rest...

### On Electoral Districts
Returning to election discussions, let me conclude with district specifics. Knowing I supported the Japan Conservative Party set a foundation, though individual district candidate choices complicated decisions.

Of 32 candidates in the Tokyo district, I was only aware of one, Ami Tomoka from Sanseito, well-known from “Takaaki Mitsuhashi TV.” Although initially considering supporting her given chances lean towards Sanseito, aligning district goals with a consistent party bolsters coherence. Consequently, I voted for Eiji Kosaka, unfamiliar yet ideologically aligned.

My decision to vote for Haruo Kitamura in proportional representation underwent similar reasoning: party-wide alignment. Moreover, not all prefectures boasted Conservative Party candidates, leaving me grateful to participate in Tokyo's district.

### Addendum
After writing this, seeing Eiji Kosaka’s passionate arguments about the National Defense Mobilization Law during an AbemaTV debate left me concerned. While supporting party-wide representation, a lack of deeper district candidate awareness serves as a cautionary tale.
