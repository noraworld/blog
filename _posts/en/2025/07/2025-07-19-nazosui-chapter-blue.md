Yesterday, July 18th, I went to Kawasui (Kawasaki Aquarium) with someone I met on a dating app. We both live close to Kawasaki, so we decided to visit Kawasui. I made the promise after they helped me pick out some clothes last month, right after which they invited me. We were supposed to go last week, but our schedules didn‚Äôt match. We rescheduled for this Monday, but because of a typhoon, we ended up going yesterday.

This wasn't my first time at Kawasui. I went once before with a friend last year, so this was my second visit.

Since I've been staying up all night lately, we decided to meet at the station at 3 PM. I've been having trouble sleeping, so I went to bed at 10 PM the night before and woke up just before 1 PM. Even though I had enough sleep, I still felt groggy and had a headache, maybe because my sleep schedule is all messed up. After brushing my teeth and taking a shower, I headed to the station.

We met up at the clock tower at the station and headed to Kawasui. I didn‚Äôt really remember the way since I‚Äôd only been there once before, but luckily, my friend knew where they were going. On our way there, we talked about how Kawasui opened during the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused it to struggle financially, leading to a change in management.

I hadn't done any research beforehand, but it turned out that there was a mystery-solving event called "NazoSui" happening, so we decided to join in while exploring the aquarium.

NazoSui was divided into 5 chapters, each taking anywhere from over an hour to more than two hours to complete. You can't finish all the chapters in one day due to its length. There wasn‚Äôt a specific order, but we chose to participate in the "Blue" chapter.

The mystery-solving was conducted using LINE. We first paid the participation fee at the Komorebi Cafe, where we received a mystery-solving booklet. At the beginning of this booklet, there was a QR code that we scanned to add a LINE account called ‚ÄúYuyu.‚Äù We started the mystery-solving by typing "Nice to meet you" or "Long time no see," which initiated a conversation. Then, following the on-screen instructions, we went around the aquarium to various mystery-solving points as we progressed through the story.

I can‚Äôt disclose the exact content of the mystery-solving, but it was quite challenging. The chapter we joined, "Blue," had an estimated playtime of over 1.5 hours, but it took us about 2.5 hours. We struggled with some parts, using hints and even solutions as time ran out, yet it still took that long. Some solutions didn‚Äôt make much sense, even after seeing them. Being a paid mystery event, the difficulty seemed intentionally high to avoid it being too easy or quick.

There was one issue: the mystery-solving required LINE, but the phone reception inside the aquarium was poor, which delayed our progress a few times. We had to move to areas with slightly better signal. I use Rakuten Mobile, and while it‚Äôs known for spotty reception, my friend, who wasn‚Äôt using Rakuten Mobile (probably Docomo), also faced similar issues, suggesting the location wasn‚Äôt ideal for good reception.

You don‚Äôt have to solve all of NazoSui in one go. If you can‚Äôt finish a chapter during a single visit, you can hold onto the booklet and continue it next time you visit. You‚Äôd have to pay the entrance fee again, though.

After completing a mystery, if you go to the corner selling goods and present a certificate of completion, you get a badge. Each chapter has a different badge, and if you clear all chapters, you receive a special badge. While I don‚Äôt plan on visiting often enough to finish all chapters, it‚Äôs a nice place to visit once in a while.

The event's duration wasn‚Äôt clear when I looked it up, but such events usually last about a year.

Since we started at 3 PM and did NazoSui, we didn‚Äôt get to see the entire aquarium, but it was nice to see fish, reptiles, birds, and more after such a long time. Just watching them was quite relaxing.

‚ñ≤ A bird ü¶Ö whose name I forgot. I think it was a laughing something.

‚ñ≤ Some kind of catfish. Its name had "cat" in it since catfish means "namazu" in Japanese.

Even though it's an aquarium, you can see not just aquatic creatures but birds too. I heard the bird section turns into a flying squirrel area depending on the time.

Since my friend had to leave by evening, we parted ways at the station after solving NazoSui. We‚Äôd planned to grab a quick bite later, but NazoSui took longer than expected.

I knew there was a cat cafe next to the aquarium from my last visit, but it seems there‚Äôs also a dog cafe. I haven‚Äôt been to either, so if I visit again, I‚Äôd like to check them out, too.
