Today, I tried [Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) for the first time.

I had been using ChatGPT when coding before. I'd take the results, understand them, and use them by copying only the necessary parts. So, the code I wrote always felt like it was "mine."

But today, I was coding for fun and got stuck on how to write something. So, I decided to install Codex and give it a try. I installed the [VS Code extension](https://developers.openai.com/codex/ide), authenticated it, and started using it. I think it said you need to be a Plus member to use it, but I was already subscribed to Plus, so it worked fine for me.

When I asked Codex to modify a part of my code, it modified it for me. I didn't fully understand the algorithm by reading the changed code right away, but when I ran it, it worked exactly as I instructed. So, for that part of the code I was struggling with, I didn't have to touch the code at all.

I knew about Codex before and considered using it if it could help develop things more efficiently. But having AI look at my code and change it by itself felt a bit strange to me. Seeing AI's code replace my previously written code gave me a feeling like my creation was being taken away.

Of course, the changes weren't big, so I could have fixed them myself if needed. But worrying about writing neatly or avoiding future issues kept me from starting, and a lot of time passed without any progress. Letting AI handle it meant getting a complete version in front of me without any indecision, which seemed fine.

However, like this article that isn't AI-generated, there's a human desire to value things we've created ourselves. There's satisfaction and attachment in writing code by ourselves. But we also want to realize our ideas with minimal effort. Especially when it comes to shaping those ideas, we sometimes see more value in the final product than the process itself, which causes impatience to achieve it quickly. Itâ€™s this conflict between wanting to create something ourselves and wanting things done easily that makes me unsure about how I should write my hobby code.

Moreover, I wondered if AI could generate text like this blog too, so I had it generate a draft of a blog post I planned to publish about the value of my notes. It created the text for me. Codex also edited files automatically, and recently, a note AI support feature was introduced, so I tried it there too, which also helped craft the article nicely.

For blog posts, I had a slightly different reaction compared to code. With code, if the final result works as I imagined, it's not a big deal. But for blog articles, it might not express what I wanted to convey, which is what happened. This made me think writing myself is better. Of course, if I can't think of good expressions or want to publish rough notes, using AI might still be useful.

Still, AI now produces decent outputs, making me wonder if we even need humans anymore. That has both good and questionable aspects. If you only care about the final product, it's a great tool that creates ideas instantly without much effort. But if you find joy in the creative process itself and take pride in owning the results, you'll be hesitant to rely on AI.

In the end, you might just use it if you want, or not use it if you don't. But if you value creating things for yourself and are aware of AI's convenience, you might find it hard to see value in your work, seeing it as wasting time and effort inefficiently. Before, achieving your ideas felt like something "only you could do," but now it feels like "anyone can do it" as long as they know how to use AI.

Of course, that's how progress works. Those who deny it often get left behind. But perhaps now I understand how predecessors felt when they couldn't accept new advancements. It's a completely different experience to be born in a world where something always existed compared to being forced to adapt to new things suddenly.

How should I approach creative activities in the future?
