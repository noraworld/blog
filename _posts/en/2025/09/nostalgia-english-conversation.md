Once the goal of living abroad vanished, I couldn't keep up with the online English lessons I did almost every day, leaving me with a sense of exhaustion and the sadness that I might not be able to chat with familiar teachers anymore."

### English Conversation Lessons
Today, I finally adjusted my messed-up sleep schedule[^circadian_rhythm] and felt like trying an English conversation lesson after a long break.

[^circadian_rhythm]: Saying it's adjusted might be misleading. My circadian rhythm doesn't seem to align with 24 hours, and I'm often careless, so my routine can get out of whack regularly. It's likely I'll find myself up at odd hours again soon, but for now, it means I managed to wake up in the morning today.

However, when I tried to book a lesson, none of my three favorite teachers had availability. It wasn't about having to book far in advance; they were entirely unavailable.

These three teachers were especially easy and fun to talk to, and I had become a regular with them. Until last year, I was doing lessons almost daily unless there was a specific reason not to, and even when I lacked motivation and took breaks, it wasn't for very long.

This year, though, I started slacking off more. Until around February, I was keeping up, but as March came, I gradually lost my momentum, and now I hardly do lessons at all.

The reason is quite clear to me. Losing the goal of living abroad and the psychological burden of scheduling were main factors. Moreover, I can no longer book my favorite teachers.

### Life in Australia
From the end of July to the end of October last year, I was living in Australia for three months on a working holiday visa. The initial plan was to find a job there and work while experiencing what it's like to live abroad firsthand, as a way to broaden my future options.

But reality was tough. Many people were flocking to Australia after COVID-19, and I couldn't find any work. I mainly tried applying online for engineering or office jobs, but even after sending applications to around 100 companies, I couldn't even get interviews, let alone a job. The abundance of job seekers and the restrictions of the working holiday visa, which only allows working with the same employer for up to six months, were significant obstacles.

I've never worked a typical part-time job like the ones in cafés or convenience stores. I tutored and did some engineering work in college, but I've never done customer service. The thought of doing customer service, in English, in an unfamiliar place, seemed daunting. Additionally, interacting with people is something I struggle with, so I didn't want to do it and didn't consider it an option from the start. Finding such jobs typically involves on-the-ground resume distribution, a proactive sales-like approach I have no experience with and think requires a strong mentality I don't possess. I felt it would be beneficial in breaking out of my shell and could improve language skills, but I just couldn't muster the courage.

In the end, I couldn't find work, and before going abroad, I wasn't working in Japan either. I was essentially a NEET, using the excuse of studying English. I really was doing lessons almost daily. But my savings were running low, and I had to find a way to earn income while there. Ultimately, I got introduced to a fully remote freelance gig I could do from abroad, which became my first freelance experience.

Even though my goal was to learn how to make a living abroad, I ended up just living there while working remotely without really interacting with locals. It made me question why I went through the process of getting a visa and preparing for this. Honestly, I didn't even enjoy living abroad as much as I'd imagined. I intended to write a post about what made it so hard, but I've procrastinated it. In short, living in Sydney was tough because the rent was incredibly high and I had to share a house, which I had also never done before.

I don't cook, but ready-made meals weren't as available as in Japan, so eating was rough. The frozen foods were unpleasant, and the rice tasted terrible. Prices for groceries were high, especially when compared to Japan, even considering yen depreciation. A simple sandwich cost around A$8. I realized cereal was cost-effective and resorted to eating it most of the time.

Financially, it was hard because I was earning in yen while living with Australia's higher cost of living, and my savings were dwindling. I only received payment from the freelance work two months after starting, after I'd already returned to Japan, underlining that my financial preparation was insufficient.

Thus, my first experience living abroad didn't meet my expectations. I even started questioning whether I truly wanted to live abroad at all. My desire was more about having an escape plan from Japan's disaster risks or economic uncertainty rather than an actual glamorous living experience abroad. Realizing I didn't have a strong passion for living overseas led me to abandon that dream, or goal.

After returning at the end of October last year, I kept up a somewhat regular lesson routine until around February, but from March on, I lost the drive. Without the desire to live abroad, I questioned my reasons for continuing English lessons, and my participation diminished.

### The Psychological Strain of Laziness
Another reason was the psychological stress of having to adjust my life to a scheduled time. I’m currently job-hunting, so essentially, I can sleep and wake at any time. Work meetings have a justifiable force making me align my schedule, but online English lessons, being self-motivated, didn’t resonate with me in timing my activities.

It's hard for me to maintain disciplined routines, and I tend to stay up watching movies or videos until I naturally tire out. Similarly, hobby coding can suddenly demand my focus when new ideas pop up. I’ve had instances where I had to pause these to attend a lesson, which was inconvenient.

Recently, my sleep being inconsistent due to shifting times—sometimes just going to sleep or barely staying awake for a lesson—added more stress and made me reluctant to schedule lessons. Simply put, I'm messy. I dislike breaking pre-planned commitments, but when the moment comes, I prefer doing something else or even sleeping, creating psychological strain.

### The Purpose of Continuing
Still, I previously had the purpose of improving English for going abroad, and I genuinely enjoyed speaking with my familiar teachers. I've always been bad at social relationships, limiting my interactions. Before going abroad, I wasn't interacting with people while not working, so the lessons were my sole means of communication.

Though I remain jobless now, after returning, I've been meeting friends in person more often. Also, my previous workplace had a nice atmosphere, allowing for social interactions at the office and occasional outings. With plans to start working again after my job search, some level of socializing will naturally return.

Given this shift, I wonder how beneficial the English lessons really are for me. Speaking with favorite teachers is fun, and I learn English—it’s enlightening to understand different cultures and lifestyles.

However, the goal of living abroad diminished, reducing the need to learn English, and the lesson fees are high. I pay annually during the Black Friday offers, which lessen the burden, but it still costs over 200,000 yen. With the yen’s depreciation and uncertain discounts, costs could rise. 

Knowing English remains a beneficial skill[^phone_call], and talking with teachers is enjoyable, so I considered restarting lessons. But, with my favorite teachers unavailable, my motivation isn’t what it was—if I can’t converse with them, I might not restart at all.

[^phone_call]: Right here, I got a call about overdue tax payments.

As mentioned, the English lessons are paid annually and auto-renew during Black Friday. The next payment will be in about three months. If I don't restart lessons, there's no justification for the hefty fees. I can’t afford it amidst financial issues, so I might cancel, losing communication with those favorite teachers, a saddening thought.

### Another Issue
Speaking of which, as I wrote this, I got a phone call. It was from the tax office, about overdue payments for this year's resident tax. I have much to say on this topic, but it would veer off the main subject and lengthen this post, so I’ll cover it separately if I feel inclined.
