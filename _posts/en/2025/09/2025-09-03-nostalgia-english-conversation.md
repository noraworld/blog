description: "To be honest, I never had a clear vision of living abroad. As a result, my online English conversations, which I used to do almost daily, started to wane. I felt a mix of exhaustion and sadness at the thought that I might no longer be able to talk with the teachers I was familiar with."

### English Conversation Lessons
Today, I finally fixed my reversed sleep schedule[^circadian_rhythm] and felt like trying an English conversation lesson again for the first time in a while.

[^circadian_rhythm]: Saying it was "fixed" is misleading. I seem to have a circadian rhythm that can't adjust to the 24-hour day, and since I'm sloppy, my sleep cycle regularly gets messed up. So after some time, I'll probably reverse my sleep cycle again, but for now, I'm waking up in the morning.

However, when I tried to book a lesson, all three of my favorite teachers had no availability. It wasn't a case of them being booked up in advance; they simply had no open slots.

These three teachers were particularly easy and fun to talk to, and I had become a regular. Up until last year, I attended lessons almost every day unless there was a specific reason not to, and even if I skipped for a period, it wasn't for too long.

But starting this year, I became quite lazy. Until around February, I was still keeping it up regularly, but by March, I started losing the consistency, and now I barely do it at all.

The reason is quite clear to me. I've lost the goal of living abroad and found scheduling burdensome. On top of that, I can no longer book my favorite teachers.

### Life in Australia
From the end of July to the end of October last year, I lived in Australia for three months. I went there on a working holiday visa. The plan was to find a job locally, experience what it was like to live abroad, and use that as a stepping stone to broaden future options.

But reality turned out to be difficult. As COVID-19 restrictions lifted, many people flocked to Australia, and I couldn't find a job at all. I aimed to do engineering or clerical work and applied online, but after about 100 applications, I couldn't even land an interview, let alone get hired. This was partly due to an oversupply of workers, but also because with a working holiday visa, you can only work for the same employer for a maximum of six months, which doesn't fit well with positions like engineering that involve mid-to-long-term projects.

I've never experienced the typical part-time jobs people usually do. During college, I worked as a tutor and did engineering work, but never in customer service jobs like at a café or convenience store. Having no experience in Japan, and doing customer service in English in a foreign land was even more challenging. Plus, I'm not fond of talking to people in general and didn't really want to do those jobs, so I didn't consider them from the start. Moreover, finding such jobs typically involves distributing your resume locally, which feels like the kind of sales job pitches that require strong mental skills—something I lack. While service-oriented jobs are better for language acquisition and breaking out of one's shell, I just couldn't muster the courage.

In the end, I couldn’t find a job. Before going, I was also unemployed for a while in Japan. Honestly, I was just a NEET, but to save face, I said I was studying English. I actually did lessons almost daily. So my savings were running out, and I needed to earn money while I was there. I ended up finding a completely remote freelance contract job through a referral, which I worked on from abroad. This was actually my first freelance gig.

The original purpose of going abroad was to find a way to live there, but it just ended up with me residing overseas without needing to interact with locals. I wondered why I went through the trouble of getting a visa and preparing to go there. And despite all that, if living overseas was enjoyable, it would be fine, but it was honestly very tough. I planned to write an article about what exactly was tough, but never got around to it because it felt like a hassle. However, in short, I lived in Sydney, where rent is extremely high, making living alone difficult, so I had to stay in a share house, which I had never experienced before. It was my first time living abroad and experiencing a share house, so I faced various challenges.

I don't cook, and unlike Japan, there wasn't a lot of ready-made food available, so I struggled with meals too. There were frozen meals available, but they tasted bad, especially the rice, which was surprisingly terrible. Food prices are high in Australia; a simple (and not very tasty) sandwich cost about A$8. Around halfway through, I realized cereal had good cost performance, so I mostly ate cereal.

Since I earned in Japanese yen while living with Australian expenses and my savings were dwindling, it was financially tough. While this was largely due to insufficient savings since the payment came two months after starting work, by which time I was back in Japan, the high cost of living was partially due to poor preparation.

Overall, my first experience living abroad was far from what I had imagined, and I became disillusioned. In hindsight, I began doubting if I really wanted to live abroad. My desire stemmed not from wanting a glamorous life abroad or engaging with locals but from concerns about Japan's disaster risk (earthquakes and tsunamis) and economic future. I wanted the option to live abroad as a fallback plan to gain peace of mind that I could flee overseas if needed. This defensive stance revealed that my enthusiasm for overseas living wasn't genuine.

Thus, I lost my dream or goal of living abroad. I returned at the end of October last year, and kept up lessons routinely until February, but by March, I started questioning why I was still taking English lessons if I didn’t want to live abroad, leading to irregular attendance.

### Psychological Burden Due to Laziness
Another reason is the psychological burden of having to align my lifestyle with scheduled lessons. Currently, I'm job searching and not working, so I can technically sleep and wake whenever I want. If it's for mandatory work meetings, it's one thing because it’s for money (life), but aligning my life with a hobby like online English lessons doesn’t quite suit me.

I've always struggled with maintaining disciplined action and lifestyle; if an interesting movie or video catches my eye, I continue watching until I can't stay awake any longer, even past bedtime. Also, with coding as a hobby, sometimes ideas spontaneously arise and I feel like implementing them immediately. More than once, I have had to interrupt my hobby coding sessions for lessons.

Also, with my cycle recently reversed, keeping awake for a lesson despite being tired created significant psychological stress, contributing to me refraining from booking lessons. Simply put, it’s due to my sloppiness. I'm sloppy, so even if I set a fixed time, I might want to do something else or sleep, and even though I don't want to break a planned schedule, attending lessons felt burdensome.

### The Value of Continuing
Despite these challenges, having a goal of acquiring English proficiency for overseas living was motivating, and talking to familiar teachers was purely enjoyable. I naturally avoid human interactions and rarely socialize with people. Before going abroad, I wasn't working, meaning social interactions were almost non-existent, making lesson conversations with my teachers my only human contact.

Currently, although still unemployed, I have had more opportunities to meet and chat with friends. My previous job had a good team atmosphere, so I interacted with colleagues and attended drinking parties. As I continue job hunting and return to work, I'll have at least basic social interactions.

With this change, I’m questioning the merits of continuing English lessons. As mentioned, chatting with favorite teachers is fun, it aids English learning, exposes me to different cultures, lifestyles, and perspectives, which is stimulating and informative.

However, without a goal for living abroad, the relative benefits of speaking English are lessened, and the lessons are expensive. I usually don't consider this since I pay an annual fee during Black Friday sales, but it costs over 200,000 yen even with a 50% discount. With the weak yen, the next payment might be even higher, and the discount isn't guaranteed to last forever.

Still, gaining English skills could certainly benefit future endeavors[^phone_call], and chats with teachers are simply enjoyable, so I thought about resuming lessons. But finding out my favorite teachers were unavailable led me to wonder if I should not bother.

[^phone_call]: At this moment, I got a call about overdue tax payments.

My English lessons are on an annual auto-renewal plan, paid during the Black Friday sales, and the next billing is due in about three months. Without resuming lessons, considering the hefty cost and financial challenges I face now, I may have to cancel. If that happens, I won't be able to talk with the teachers I've grown fond of, which saddens me.

### A Different Matter
Changing topics, I received a call while writing this article. It was from the tax office regarding my overdue resident tax payments for this fiscal year. I have a lot to say about this, but explaining it would deviate from the main topic and be lengthy, so I might write about it in a separate article if I feel like it.
