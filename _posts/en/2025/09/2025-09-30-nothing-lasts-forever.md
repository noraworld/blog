It's not a new thing, but sometimes I think about what will happen to my assets after I die. It sounds dramatic to call them assets, but it's really just the things I've done that remain as a part of me, like this blog. I often wonder what will happen to these records, which are proof of my existence in this world, after I'm gone.

The recent trigger was [the freezing of my account by `mail.com`][mail_com], which made me realize how even a favorite email address or account name could become unusable at the will of the service provider.

[mail_com]: This time was triggered by `mail.com` freezing my account, showing how even favorite email addresses and account names can become unusable at the provider's discretion.

Some people actually don't want their records to remain. A YouTuber named Retoruto once said he wishes all of his videos would automatically disappear the moment he dies[^beyond]. I don't know if he meant it seriously or was joking, but it's another way to think about it.

[^beyond]: I think it was during the Navajo chapter in Beyond: Two Souls. I’m too lazy to look it up and add a link.

But I'm quite the opposite. I want my records to remain after I've died. To be honest, I'm not successful in any particular realm, like Retoruto, nor can I find motivation at work. I often lose jobs and struggle financially. It's easy to say it's my own fault, but I also feel burdened by not being able to find meaning in work, among other worries.

By documenting and sharing my daily life, my trials, and even my emotions as records, I attempt to find a little bit of solace, even if only a few people see them. And maybe, just maybe, my records will continue to exist after I'm gone, letting me find some meaning in my lifetime.

However, reality is harsh. Once you die, you can't control anything. Bank accounts and credit cards get frozen and terminated as soon as your death is confirmed. This is generally accepted, but it means services that require payments, like subscriptions, disappear.

One such service is a custom domain. Custom domains usually require an annual payment, even though the cost isn't particularly high. But after death, it's tough to pay. It doesn't matter how much money you had before dying; a frozen bank account means you can't pay. It’s not about the amount.

There's a limit to prepayment. For example, `.com` domains can be prepaid up to 10 years in advance, but that's still just 10 years. Even if I signed a 10-year contract right before dying, my records would only survive a decade after my death.

Leaving it to your heirs isn't practical for me. I have a strained relationship with my parents and haven't been in touch or met them for years. Even if relations were good, they'd naturally die first. Disasters or accidents aside, that's the way life goes.

I have no spouse at the moment. Even if I did, the age gap wouldn't be significant, so without unexpected events, we'd likely pass on around the same time. Plus, I only have one spouse, so if I happen to pass away young, the time they can carry on my records would be limited.

Should I entrust it to my children? It seems odd to pass personal records to children. Should a child have their children, and so on, pass it forward? Why should I enforce my ego like that? Besides, I don't want children, much less for this purpose.

Could I create a corporation, or use a legal entity or trust? If I were as important as Leonardo da Vinci, my diaries might hold value, but otherwise, creating or maintaining a corporation just to preserve my records isn't feasible. Even trust funds need financial resources, which deplete after death with no further income. Moreover, choosing trusts excludes inheritance to family, which someone as ego-driven as me can't leave behind.

None of these options fit my life. Thinking about ways my records could survive alone after death led me to realize individuals aren't like corporations or countries; it's tough to preserve one’s records forever. While well-known entities might have their history preserved, an individual’s "personal history" must be self-managed at every step. As it stands, there’s no way to keep personal records forever.

Checking [ChatGPT's advice](https://chatgpt.com/share/68db6df0-fb64-8004-8880-e2b9cdb159f9) confirmed my previous conclusion that using free platforms like GitHub Pages (`github.io`) is the practical solution when you can't afford subscriptions. It’s my only real option. Besides that, keeping a backup on Internet Archive might help.

I trust GitHub enough to host my blog there, but it doesn't promise eternity. I use GitHub every day now, so account inactivity isn't a threat, but death changes that.

Policies might change, posing threats. Just look at Twitter. (Free services always have this risk.) Avoiding such service restrictions means paying for hosting, with all associated costs, unsustainable postmortem.

Until there's an eternal, fail-safe way to preserve records, sticking too tightly to them might be pointless. I've always put record-keeping above all, but that obsession brought stress. I even avoided deviating from routine, as recording big events required time and effort. This, I realize now, has made life dull.

Nonetheless, I’ll keep documenting. Even if it's not forever, sharing might help someone in similar situations. By going public with what I've lived through, I can turn my struggles into stories rewarding while I’m alive. Yet, too much fixation on records shouldn't sacrifice my present life or future, nor should it compromise what I love or want to do.

From now on, I'm aiming for a more relaxed, desire-driven life. Minimal record-keeping is sufficient, as long as I recall what happened and when. Overly focusing on perfect recording shouldn't waste my "now." I'm shifting from record-centric to happiness-centric living.
