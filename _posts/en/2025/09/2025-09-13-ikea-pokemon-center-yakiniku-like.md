### Trip to IKEA with a Friend
Today, I went to IKEA in Minami-Funabashi with a friend. It’s a well-known furniture brand, so of course, I’ve heard of it before, but it might be my first time actually roaming around inside. Our goal wasn’t to buy furniture, though, but rather to have lunch at the restaurant inside. My friend often visits IKEA specifically for the restaurant. When we planned to meet up, we decided to go to IKEA since we hadn’t visited the Minami-Funabashi store before.

Funabashi reminds me of the training I attended for the company I joined after graduating. It was where I became friends with my buddy in the same group. It’s a nice memory now. The area around the station has many large shopping facilities like Lalaport and food courts, so it’s convenient and not too crowded, maybe because it’s a Friday.

### Lunch
We met at Minami-Funabashi station around 3 PM and headed to IKEA for a late lunch. The restaurant felt like a big cafeteria.

I hadn’t had roast beef in a while. It was a bit tough, and there were parts I couldn’t chew well. The sauce and mashed potatoes were quite flavorful.

### Room Sets
After discussing politics and capitalism briefly, we decided to browse the furniture section, admiring various IKEA room setups while chatting. We couldn’t see everything as the place was huge.

From the [room sets](https://chatgpt.com/share/68c47fad-441c-8004-8a7c-79c497bc6943) we looked at, my friend seemed to prefer stylish and calming rooms. As it turns out, my friend recently started dating someone. We talked about what kind of room would be nice if they moved in together.

On the other hand, when asked what kind of room I’d like, I couldn’t picture anything specific. While I could answer which pieces I liked better individually, I didn’t have a clear idea of how I’d want everything arranged as a whole. I expressed that I had no particular preferences and would be okay living in any room.

When my friend asked if I’d be fine moving into a room completely decorated by a girlfriend, I said I’d be totally okay with it. I’m not picky about food, movies, or furniture arrangements and would rather leave these decisions to a partner. Some say this isn’t an attractive quality in guys.

At one point, we saw a piece of furniture labeled "LACK," which was shaped like a small shelf.

I assumed it was a mistake since "lack" sounds like "missing" in English, and shelving seemed more like "rack." But IKEA wouldn't make such a mistake, so I checked, and it turns out [it means lacquer in Swedish](https://chatgpt.com/share/68c47fa1-a020-8004-8ec8-4b759e355dc1). It was a good reminder not to assume things based on English.

Lately, I've been wanting a standing desk because my current setup is uncomfortable and not very ergonomic. I stumbled across a promising one at IKEA.

Though I'm currently job hunting and my budget is tight, I hope to get a desk like that one day. The concern is whether a fixed-height desk would match my height well.

### Lalaport
After browsing, we originally planned to grab a light snack back at the IKEA restaurant. But we decided to check out Lalaport instead. Their food court was nicely uncrowded, although we couldn’t find a cozy place to sit.

### Pokémon Center
Next, we headed to Lalaport, which also had a Pokémon Center that was still open. We went in to look around before it closed.

My friend doesn’t know much about Pokémon, aside from the first generation. While I don’t play much now, I used to love it, and maybe my friend saw me as a Pokémon fan. My current LINE theme is even Pokémon-themed.

### Yakiniku Like
After the Pokémon visit, it was getting late, so we decided to have dinner at Yakiniku Like.

It’s been a while since I had yakiniku, and this was my first time at Yakiniku Like. Instead of sharing a grill, everyone grills individually, and I was a bit worried since I hadn’t grilled on my own much. I enjoyed mixing lemon juice in the sauce, and the rice was really good; I should've ordered more.

#### Apple New Releases
After dinner, we chatted about Apple’s new product announcements. I’d like to upgrade my iPhone and Apple Watch because my current ones are outdated. The problem is affording them right now.

I want a bigger iPhone and a longer battery life, especially since my Series 4 Apple Watch barely lasts a day. I wouldn’t mind getting AirPods Pro 3 since the latest version has better noise-canceling features and is waterproof.

I’ll have to think about eSIM soon as the next iPhone models might not support physical SIM cards.

### Saizeriya
We usually end our gatherings at Saizeriya to chat until late at night. I ordered my favorite cold pumpkin soup, which is back for a limited time, alongside carbonara.

### Romance Talk
We moved to discussing romance, especially since my friend now has a girlfriend. They started dating in July, but my friend didn't share many details about their relationship. They meet about once a week.

Separately, my friend mentioned a high school classmate they reconnected with at a wedding. This person seems quite unique, expressing interest in things like threesomes, which my friend found intriguing. Seeing their picture, I thought they were quite cute as well.

#### Struggles with Romance
I listened with interest, but a part of me felt envious of my friend’s successful social life. In contrast, my attempts with dating apps have been fruitless. Back in July, I was lightly using the apps again, but nothing worked out as I couldn't feel any chemistry with anyone I met.

Even though I tried to maintain friendships, it felt insincere, leading to conflicts, and we’re no longer in touch. I'm nearing an age where it feels unlikely to suddenly meet someone I genuinely connect with, and I'm worried about having no experience for when that rare chance comes.

Having a girlfriend might be convenient, but the process feels tedious and exhausting. Yet, an intrinsic desire remains for a partner—it’s an internal battle between longing and the ease of being alone.

While my friend also struggles with being considerate in relationships, it seems to come more naturally to them. I’m happy for them but simultaneously feel inadequate in my own life. These contrasting emotions left me uneasy and reflective.

As I headed home, I got off one station early to walk and sort my thoughts. It had been forecasted to rain, and indeed as soon as I left the station, rain began to pour, intensifying my contemplation as if echoing my inner turmoil.
