### Got a Nintendo Switch!
I bought a Nintendo Switch just a week ago.

### Reason for Purchase
I hadn’t always planned on buying it, and I was quite undecided about whether to get it.

There were two main reasons I decided to purchase it.

One reason was that I could play with my colleagues. There’s a Slack channel where Splatoon holders among my colleagues gather, deciding on when to play together, and it looked really fun.

The other reason was watching the series “Yoiko's Indie Game Treasure Hunting Life” (all 4 episodes) on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/NintendoJPofficial" target="_blank">Nintendo’s official YouTube channel</a>, and the indie games released on Switch seemed so fascinating.

Among the indie games introduced in this series, the ones that particularly caught my interest were “Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime” (“ロロロロ” in Japanese), “UnEpic,” and “Celeste.” I first bought “Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime,” which I will introduce later.

### The Amazement of Amazon Prime Now
The timing of the purchase was very whimsical. Although I wanted it due to the reasons mentioned above, I didn’t feel an overwhelming need for it and thought I could buy it anytime, so I was in a state of mind where I wasn't in a hurry.

However, last weekend, I had absolutely nothing to do (felt unmotivated to do anything), and I was looking at the Switch on Amazon when the temptation suddenly struck, and I impulsively clicked purchase...!

Moreover, once I decided to buy it, I wanted to get it immediately, so I tried using Amazon Prime Now for the first time.

This service was unimaginably convenient, so I’d like to introduce it to those who don’t know. Amazon Prime Now is a divine service that delivers products in as fast as under an hour.

Although it has limitations like being available only in certain areas (Tokyo and its surroundings), limited to certain products (not all products on Amazon are available for Prime Now delivery), and additional delivery fees for under-an-hour delivery (the fastest option), it is still a remarkably convenient service.

I was in a state of mind eager to play soon, so I used the under-an-hour, paid option. It arrived in about 50 minutes after clicking purchase, and I was really impressed it came within an hour.

The Nintendo Switch was available on Amazon Prime Now. Also, I’d heard the Nintendo Switch has only 32GB of internal storage, so I bought a micro SD card along with it. I also purchased a protective seal to protect the screen.

As an aside, I’ve decided to purchase all future game software as downloadable content for reasons such as finding it cumbersome to switch cartridges, wanting to be able to play as soon as I buy it at home, and leaving purchase information on the account. Therefore, I chose a 256GB micro SD for more storage.

I bought the Switch main unit, micro SD card, and protective seal together, and enjoyed Splatoon that day. But I thought a Pro controller might be easier to use, so I later bought a Pro controller via Amazon Prime Now again.

Amazon Prime Now is so convenient that you need to be careful... haha.

### Software Purchased
The first game I purchased was Splatoon because I wanted to play with my colleagues.

Next, I bought Mario Kart. Mario Kart is apparently very popular, and it was nostalgic for me since the last time I played Mario Kart was on the Wii, so I bought it.

Lastly, I bought “Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime.” It was introduced in the “Yoiko's Indie Game Treasure Hunting Life,” and I thought it seemed particularly interesting.

“Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime” is, to put it simply, a cooperative puzzle game with friends. It has 2-player and 4-player options, each with its own stages (content), but you can also play it solo by controlling 2 (or 4) characters.

I originally bought it to play alone, but recently I had a chance to gather with colleagues and play Splatoon, and after the match, I recommended “Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime” for us to try together. It turned out to be hilariously fun enough to leave you in stitches.

You guide robots (AI) to the goal in cooperation, but a slight operational mistake can lead to hitting other companions with a beam, impaling them on spikes, or launching them off the field. Even without any ill-intent, you might end up destroying your companion robots, causing chaos in the game, which is incredibly fun. It’s the first time in my life a puzzle game made me laugh so much.

There are many other fascinating titles like “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild” and “Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker,” and I plan to buy them eventually if they pique my interest.

### What’s Great About Switch!
I’d like to briefly summarize the good points, surprising aspects, and things I found amazing about purchasing the Nintendo Switch.

#### The Graphics Are Beautiful
Handheld game consoles generally seem to have coarser graphics compared to home consoles, but the Switch’s graphics far exceeded my fantasies, so I was amazed. Even the display of the Switch is beautifully clear, and connecting it to the TV gives you a crisp, large-screen gaming experience which is just fantastic.

#### Wireless Console and Controllers
PS4 has this too, so maybe this is standard for recent game consoles, but personally, I find this to be a big plus. With both the Joy-Con and Pro controller, you can operate them separated from the console, allowing you to lie down and play midway.

Of course, you can connect and play with the console, and during charging, you need to connect to some device, but basically, being able to operate separate from the console is handy. The long battery life of the Pro controller is also a good point.

#### Extremely Smooth Switch Between Console Display and TV Connection
This is the most impressive point to me personally. It’s remarkable enough that you can connect a handheld game console to a TV, but the easiness of the switch is truly wonderful.

If the dock is connected to the TV and power, you simply insert the Switch into the dock to automatically switch the connection to the TV. You can enjoy the games on the Switch’s screen while you're out and switch to the TV for large-screen enjoyment when you’re home, making it a very flexible and user-friendly device.

### Conclusion
I’m quite satisfied with my purchase, even though it was almost a compulsive buy. I had initially been undecided about whether to purchase it and knew there were many fun games, so I thought I’d buy it eventually, but I didn’t expect myself to order it so impulsively, so I surprised myself haha.

This time, I used Amazon Prime Now for the first time and realized how convenient it is, so I think it was a good purchase. (Though my money seems to be diminishing rapidly haha.)

In the future, I plan to enjoy playing alone during my free time and have fun playing Splatoon with my colleagues. Furthermore, Amazon Prime Now was incredibly convenient, so from now on, I'll consider buying things available on it through Amazon Prime Now...!
