The other day, I bought an Amazon Fire TV and thought I'd write a blog about my experience.

### Reason for Purchase  
I wanted to watch online videos on a big screen, that's it!

...... Just that would be dull, so I'll write in more detail.

I love online videos, especially YouTube, which I watch a ton. Nowadays, I sometimes skip YouTube because I'm hooked on the Nintendo Switch, but before, I watched YouTube almost every day.

Until now, I had always watched it on my PC screen, but I wanted to enjoy video content on a clear, large screen, so I wanted to watch it on my TV screen.

This is one of my bad traits: I thought about watching on a big screen before, but since it wasn't particularly inconvenient to watch on a smaller screen, I continued watching YouTube and other content on my PC. However, recently, I started watching movies and anime on Amazon Prime Video and thought, "Since I'm watching so much online video, satisfaction would be higher watching it on a big TV screen." This became the trigger for me to decide to buy a device to watch online videos on my TV.

#### Chromecast vs. Amazon Fire TV vs. Apple TV  
There are mainly three devices to watch online videos on a TV.

- Chromecast  
- Amazon Fire TV (including Fire TV Stick)  
- Apple TV  

Initially, I thought about buying a Chromecast (because I like Google services and watch YouTube the most) but discovered that Amazon Prime Video is only compatible with the Amazon Fire TV series. Conversely, I learned that the Amazon Fire TV series does not have a YouTube app.

This made it quite a dilemma. Although I watch YouTube the most, not being able to watch Amazon Prime Video, which I've been hooked on recently, is a problem... However, after researching, I found out that even though there's no YouTube app, you can watch it on Amazon Fire TV through a browser app or by mirroring your smartphone.

Additionally, in terms of supported online videos, it seems that Amazon Fire TV supports more than Chromecast, for example, Nico Nico Douga doesn't have an app on Chromecast. For these reasons, I decided to purchase the Amazon Fire TV series. Incidentally, Apple TV was initially excluded from the candidates because it supports fewer online video services compared to Chromecast and Amazon Fire TV.

#### Fire TV vs. Fire TV Stick  
Within the Amazon Fire TV series, there are two types: the slightly larger Amazon Fire TV and the stick-type, smaller Fire TV Stick. The features of both can be summarized as follows:

- Fire TV Stick is cheaper  
- Fire TV Stick is more compact and takes up less space  
- Fire TV has better performance  
- There is no difference in functionality between the two  

Initially, I considered purchasing the Stick due to its popularity for being cheaper and more compact. However, for the following reasons, I decided on the higher-performance Fire TV (not the Stick).

Firstly, regarding the price, since it's not a consumable and will be used for a long time, I didn't want to compromise based on price. As for it taking up less space, looking at product images, it seemed that Amazon Fire TV also hangs behind the TV and doesn't take up much space. Though there’s no difference in what they offer, for something used long-term, I thought better performance was preferable, leading me to choose the Fire TV over the Stick.

#### Other Options  
Although directly connecting the PC to the TV and using it as an external display is also an option, it was excluded simply because connecting it every time is a hassle. But now that I think about it, it might be due to a vague reason that I just wanted a dedicated device to watch online videos.

### What I Bought  
Here's what I purchased this time:

- Amazon Fire TV (main unit)  
- Amazon Ethernet Adapter  
- HDMI Switcher  
- LAN Cable  
- HDMI Cable  
- Power Strip  

It appears that Amazon Fire TV alone cannot perform a wired LAN connection, and since a wired connection reportedly offers more stable video playback, I purchased an Ethernet Adapter as well.

Additionally, our TV has only two HDMI ports, which are already occupied by a Nintendo Switch and PS4. Given that more devices may be connected to the TV in the future and it's a hassle to plug in and out each time, I bought a 3-port HDMI switcher.

The LAN cable was bought to connect Amazon Fire TV via a wired connection.

The HDMI cable was necessary to connect the HDMI switcher to the TV.

Finally, as for the power strip, since numerous outlets are needed around the TV area for the PS4, Nintendo Switch, and for charging the PC and smartphones, I'm using a power strip. But since it’s completely full as well, I added one more. I purchased another 6-outlet power strip I was already using, making room for 12 outlets in total. With this, I shouldn't have any more troubles regarding the number of power outlets...

### Unboxing

Connect the main unit to the TV via HDMI, and supply power through USB. Since I opted for a wired connection, the setup involves using an Ethernet Adapter between them, and by connecting the adapter to the router with a LAN cable, the main unit achieves a wired connection. Being on a wired connection, there were no internet connection settings required during the initial setup, making it very effortless.

The attached remote control includes buttons for selecting, navigating, home, back, and options, as well as play/pause, rewind, and fast forward buttons, making it very convenient for watching online videos. It’s battery-operated with AAA batteries included from the start. If not accustomed to remote operation, you can install the Amazon Fire TV Remote app on your smartphone to use your phone as a remote control.

### Thoughts after Use  
The initial setup was completed within a few minutes. "Your Name" was interesting, so after the initial setup, I watched it again on Fire TV. The picture quality was astonishingly beautiful, though this may depend on connection speed. Amazon Prime Video has an abundance of anime and films; the other day, I was feeling nostalgic for "NARUTO" and started watching early episodes, only to find them so compelling that I couldn't stop watching, spending 10 hours of my weekend on it. Although I haven't watched much anime until now, this is so entertaining that I might never have enough time...

Regarding YouTube, which I had some concerns about before purchasing, there is an app called youtube.com (an official (?) app), which allows you to watch YouTube through the Firefox or Silk browser. While it's not a dedicated YouTube app and feels slightly awkward to manipulate via a browser, it wasn't anything overly bothersome. More than that, it was moving to see YouTube on a big screen for a change, which I previously only viewed on a PC screen.

Netflix, Hulu, AbemaTV, Nico Nico Douga, Amazon Prime Video, etc., most essential online video service apps are compatible, so if you want to watch online videos on your TV, choosing an Amazon Fire TV wouldn't be a problem. If you are not watching Amazon Prime Video or Nico Nico Douga and mainly use YouTube, then Chromecast might still be a good option.

### Conclusion  
The aim this time was simply to watch on a big screen, and while it wasn’t a necessary purchase, experiencing video content on a large screen is entirely different. It's honestly excellent!

Furthermore, besides online videos, viewers can also watch terrestrial drama and anime via platforms like FOD (Fuji On-Demand), potentially taking even more of my time. As for drama, I felt like rewatching "Rich Man, Poor Woman," which aired a few years ago. Also, I haven’t seen the hit drama "We Married as a Job" yet, so I’m keen to watch it as well. Speaking of anime, being able to binge-watch "Kochikame" or "Ranma 1/2" from the start, which I loved, is fantastic.

From now on, when I watch online videos, I plan to use the Amazon Fire TV to enjoy them on the TV's large screen!
