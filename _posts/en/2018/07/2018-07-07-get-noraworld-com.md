### Introduction
Regarding the "300,000 yen" in the title, it's not exactly 300,000 yen, but rather 290,000 yen. I rounded it up to 300,000 yen for the title because "290,000 yen" doesn’t sound as neat. Since it's not overly exaggerated, I hope you'll overlook it...

### Overview
As mentioned in the title, I acquired `noraworld.com`, which had a premium price tag of 300,000 yen. I made the payment on July 1 (Sunday), and today, July 7 (Saturday), the domain transfer was completed, and I officially gained ownership.

What I primarily want to convey through this article is "I bought a domain for 300,000 yen," but since I went through the trouble, I’d like to share the process that led to its acquisition.

### Web Cache
Before getting into that, here's a note. Once you acquire a premium domain, it becomes difficult to determine whether it was indeed a premium domain. This is because a premium domain is priced high, and once it's purchased, the price can't be checked anymore.

However, I had an idea. I thought, why not record a web cache of the page that displays the price before purchasing the premium domain? So, I saved some web caches beforehand. I'm not sure whether this will serve as proof of it being a premium domain, but I'm leaving it here as a record.

### Background
The intention to acquire `noraworld.com` didn't start recently; I wanted it for a long time. It dates back to over two years ago.

I got my first domain to put my portfolio online after I became interested in the web, which was in March 2016, two years ago. I already wanted to acquire `noraworld.com` at that time.

However, `noraworld.com` had already been acquired by an obscure company back then. So I had no choice but to acquire `noraworld.jp` instead. I used this domain as my primary domain for over two years.

A few months after acquiring `noraworld.jp`, I checked again and found that the ownership of `noraworld.com` had passed from the previous company to another. This new company was the one [cybersquatting](https://www.weblio.jp/content/%E3%82%B5%E3%82%A4%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AF%E3%83%83%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0) on `noraworld.com`. I don't have proof, but the price at that time was about 430,000 yen. This was when I first learned about premium domains.

Naturally, when I saw this price, I didn't feel like paying for it. I didn't have as strong a desire or commitment to domains as I do now, so I gave up, thinking, "I can't get this domain."

### Commitment to Domains
For a while, I didn't think much about `noraworld.com`. During that time, as my commitment to web technology grew and my knowledge expanded, I gradually started acquiring other domains in addition to `noraworld.jp`.

As a result, I became fascinated by the identity-defining allure of domains. Gradually, this thought took root in my mind: "The primary domain I own establishes my identity on the Internet, making it a unique existence critical to my self-definition."

When this idea grew stronger, I realized, "To truly express who I am, `noraworld.com` is indispensable." However, I still lacked the incentive to pay 430,000 yen... At this point, the idea of targeting domain expiration crossed my mind, and I checked the domain’s expiration date on WHOIS.

I discovered that the expiration date for `noraworld.com` was June 27, 2017. I started paying attention to expiration dates sometime in 2017. So, I decided to wait until the expiration date.

### Attempt to Secure Expiration
As the expiration date approached, the time was running for the domain to be renewed, and yet there was no sign of renewal.

I thought there might be a chance to acquire it at a regular price as soon as it expired, so I waited anxiously for the moment on June 27, 2017, around the time when the date would change. Since the time posted on WHOIS was in UTC, I remember clearly waiting for that moment at 9:00 AM Japan time.

However, even after that moment passed, `noraworld.com` wasn't available for purchase at a regular price. I assumed it might take some time to reflect, so I waited several days, but nothing changed.

Feeling something was off, I researched domain expiration and learned about redemption grace periods, which I discovered only then. Depending on the TLD, these can vary, but in the case of `.com`, there is a 40-day redemption period from the expiration date during which the domain can be renewed without losing it.

I felt a bit disappointed upon learning this information, as I had expected the domain to become available as soon as its expiration passed. But since it hadn’t been renewed yet, I thought there might still be a chance to obtain it at a regular price after the 40-day period, so I continued to wait.

### Decision
By now, as you may have predicted, a few weeks after the expiration date, unfortunately, `noraworld.com` was renewed. This meant its expiration date extended to June 27, 2018.

However, I who had anticipated getting it could no longer decide to give up on `noraworld.com`. I decided that no matter how long it takes, I would definitely acquire `noraworld.com`. This was about a year ago.

At that time, I was still a student and not working much part-time, so spending 430,000 yen was far beyond my financial capability. Therefore, I resolved that once I became a professional and had an income, I would definitely buy it (I am a bit embarrassed that I didn't consider working part-time to save up...).

### About Installments
Just a small detour here, other than paying 430,000 yen outright, you could also pay in installments. If you choose to pay in installments, the domain becomes usable upon the initial payment.

However, it remains in registrar lock status, meaning if you abandon payment midway, the domain rights would be revoked and no longer usable. Once all installments are paid, the registrar lock is removed, allowing transfer to other registrars.

It's quite well done. Well, it makes sense, as without registrar lock, you could just stop paying midway and still keep the domain, so it's a natural mechanism...

But for me, the installment option was off the table from the beginning. That was because I believed even if I could use the domain partially, I wouldn't fully establish my identity.

### Price Drop
A few months after resolving to acquire `noraworld.com`, the price dropped. This was the price I ended up paying, 290,000 yen.

![Price Dropped to 290,000 yen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/get-noraworld-com/noraworld_com_is_for_sale.png)

Although the price drop made me a bit happy, it was still a significant amount that I couldn't just fork out at that moment.

### The Time Has Come
Time passed, and eventually, I became a professional. My life as a working adult officially began in April 2018, and alongside the excitement and anxieties of my new life was an equal longing for `noraworld.com`.

After receiving my payments for April and May, I finally had the financial means to pay the 290,000 yen, but I wasn't so carried away that I forgot the domain’s expiration date. Since it was June 27, 2018, of course, I waited through the month.

By this point, I had no expectations, but as expected, it was renewed. For this year, it was renewed before entering the redemption grace period, so I didn't have to wait unnecessarily, which was, in turn, good.

Just as July 1 was a Sunday and the beginning of the month, I processed the domain acquisition on July 1.

You could obtain `noraworld.com` from the page of the company that held the domain, but I was afraid of making a large payment to an unknown company, so I purchased it through GoDaddy, whom I usually use and trust.

Please note that not all registrars allow the purchase of premium domains; you need to select a registrar like GoDaddy that supports premium domain purchases.

If the registrar you wish to use doesn't support premium domain purchases, you must purchase through a supporting registrar or the domain holding company. Then, you can transfer it to the registrar you want to use, which means taking two steps. In my case, I was fortunate that the GoDaddy I frequently use supported premium domain purchases.

### Purchase
The acquisition process concluded easily. The steps were exactly the same as when acquiring a regular domain. The only difference was the astronomical purchase price.

### After Purchase
The ownership didn't transfer immediately after payment. Shortly after purchasing, all I could confirm was the 290,000 yen listed on my management page and the deduction from my bank account.

![Bank Statement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/get-noraworld-com/account_balance.png)

I trusted that a large registrar like GoDaddy would not have issues, but I was still a little anxious, so I called GoDaddy on the next day, the 2nd.

It was my first time calling GoDaddy, an overseas registrar, but I was relieved to know that their Japanese support line provides service in Japanese. (Of course, since it's a Japanese support line, it’s expected to be in Japanese...)

The operator wasn't Japanese, but their Japanese was fluent enough to understand, so there was no problem.

My inquiry revealed that some sort of process takes place between the registrar that handled the acquisition (GoDaddy) and the company that previously held the domain, after which ownership passes to the buyer. It takes about 1 to 2 weeks from the purchase procedure for the ownership to be transferred.

### Finally
Finally, about a week after purchasing the domain, around 1:00 PM on the 7th, the domain transfer was complete, and I officially acquired `noraworld.com`. After more than two years of wanting this domain, I finally got it...!

Despite having longed for `noraworld.com` for so long, I didn’t feel a strong sense of accomplishment or excitement when I got it. However, now that `noraworld.com` will become my Internet identity and reveal its true value, I think this was a very worthwhile purchase.

### Future Plans
Moving forward, I plan to transition all web pages currently on `noraworld.jp` and its subdomains to `noraworld.com`. I plan to use `noraworld.jp` for redirecting to `noraworld.com`.

However, since the portfolio currently published on `noraworld.jp` hasn't changed in a long time and lacks novelty, I intend to take this opportunity to create a new portfolio to publish on `noraworld.com`. Until then, I’ll continue using `noraworld.jp`.

Also, I plan to subscribe to <a href="https://gsuite.google.com" target="_blank">G Suite</a> to create an email address with `noraworld.com`. In the future, I intend to switch the email addresses registered with service accounts to `noraworld.com`.

### More Expensive Purchase
On the same day I purchased `noraworld.com`, I ordered the highest-spec MacBook Pro available (with 512GB of storage).

![Highest Spec MacBook Pro](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/get-noraworld-com/macbook_pro_purchase.png)

So, on July 1, I made purchases totaling **around 650,000 yen** in a single day...!

Spending 650,000 yen within just 3 months as a working adult is quite painful, but I determined both were necessary to enhance productivity and don't believe they were wasted purchases.

I had been considering buying a MacBook Pro for some time, although I hadn't decided when to buy it. However, as I would buy it eventually, I decided to purchase it alongside `noraworld.com`.

I paid for `noraworld.com` in full, but I couldn't pay for the MacBook Pro all at once, so I opted for installment payments.

The MacBook Pro is scheduled for delivery on the 8th (Sunday), and I have a little story about its purchase, but I'll save that for another article.

### Conclusion
In the coming days, I plan to invest time and effort into preparations and actions to maximize the use of `noraworld.com`.

Thank you for reading the article to the end.
