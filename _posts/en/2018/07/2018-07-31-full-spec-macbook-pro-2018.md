### The Beginning
About 3 weeks ago, on July 8, I received a fully customized MacBook Pro.

[Purchased the Highest-Spec MacBook Pro Available at the Time](https://noraworld.blog/full-spec-macbook-pro-15-inch/)

After setting it up and configuring the environment, I wrote on the blog that I had bought it and was ready to dive into development with this new MacBook Pro üí™... Just when I thought that, Apple suddenly began selling new products without any announcement.

<a href="https://japanese.engadget.com/2018/07/12/macbook-pro-8-core-6-cpu-ram-32gb/" target="_blank">Breaking: New MacBook Pro Announced Out of Nowhere. Features Up to 8th Gen Core with 6 CPU Cores and Up to 32GB of RAM</a>

Yes, the new 2018 model of the MacBook Pro...!!

On July 12, 2018, Apple suddenly made the new MacBook Pro available for purchase on its official website without any announcement.

Even at this year's WWDC, there was no announcement about a new Mac, so it was predicted that no new Mac would be available this year. And yet, just 4 days after buying my MacBook Pro, it was released. It wasn't just "Oh well!"‚ÄîI was filled with feelings of regret, thinking, "I bought one right before the new MacBook Pro was released!!!!"

Moreover, it's common for information about new Macs or iPhones to be leaked from factories in China or elsewhere, but this time, there wasn't a single leak. Who could have predicted this... When I learned about the new MacBook Pro, I honestly felt unlucky... (Although I didn't really hold a grudge).

### The Trigger for Returning
I learned about this on July 17 during my lunch break when I went to have lunch with a colleague. He told me about it, and I was immersed in disappointment, having just bought what had now become the previous generation MacBook Pro.

At the time, all I felt was "Ah, I'm not lucky...," and I had almost given up, but my colleague casually said,

"If it were me, I'd return it."

"Return, huh..."

Indeed, if I returned it and bought it again, I might be able to get the new MacBook Pro. When I asked, "Can I return it?" he quickly looked it up for me. According to Apple's website, it was stated as follows:

> Apple‚Äôs Sales and Refund Policy applies to returns. If you wish to return an item, you can arrange for a return of hardware within 14 calendar days from the time you received it. This period is only applicable if the software is unopened and can be returned within this timeframe as well.

<a href="https://www.apple.com/jp/shop/help/returns_refund" target="_blank">Returns & Refunds - Shopping Support - Apple (Japan)</a>

Surprisingly, they will accept returns free of charge within two weeks of receipt. Since I received it on the 8th, and it was already the 17th, I realized I could return it within that week.

### Haste Makes Waste
After finishing lunch and parting with my colleague, I quickly called Apple. With the order number in hand, I provided the minimal personal information from the purchase process, and they agreed to the return. The phone call covered matters such as the following. Incidentally, Apple's phone support was very courteous and helpful. Just like Apple‚Äîvery thorough.

- This call acknowledges the receipt of the return request for the MacBook Pro
- After the call, an email with the receipt number will be sent
- Within one week from this call, go to a Yamato Transport service center or convenience store, enter the receipt number into the machine to issue a receipt, and return the MacBook Pro in its box
- The returned MacBook Pro's data will be responsibly erased by Apple, but it is recommended to delete any critical data before returning
- Interest and handling fees will not be refunded
- It may take several weeks to complete the return process and cancel the credit card transaction
- Be mindful of the credit limit if purchasing a MacBook Pro again

The general process includes receiving the email, which contains a receipt number, entering that receipt number at a Yamato service center or convenience store machine, and sending it with the MacBook Pro.

There's a fee at convenience stores, but it's free at Yamato Transport, and since there was a service center close to my home, I returned it there.

After the initial setup and environment configuration of the MacBook Pro, I logged out of various accounts, backed up important data, and followed the "Steps to Take Before Selling or Giving Away Your Mac." Additionally, I cleaned off any fingerprints before putting it back in the box. Though unnecessary, I didn't want to hand it over with fingerprints all over it...

Regarding the non-refundable interest and fees, that's just how it is. While lucky to be able to return it, I lost out on the fees, but considering I could get the new MacBook Pro relatively soon, I'll let that slide.

When it comes to the credit card limit, since the cancellation of the returned MacBook Pro's payment doesn't happen instantly, the amount from the MacBook Pro that was returned remains included in the credit limit for a while. So if I buy a new MacBook Pro immediately after returning one, it would temporarily require the cost of the returned MacBook Pro + the cost of the new MacBook Pro as a credit limit.

The returned MacBook Pro was about 350,000 yen, and the new MacBook Pro that I customized at full spec was about **400,000 yen**, so it was clear I needed a limit of approximately **750,000 yen**. Fortunately, my credit card limit was 1 million yen, allowing me to immediately purchase the new MacBook Pro after the return. It would have been several more weeks of waiting if I hadn't had enough credit...

When I received the credit card with a 1 million yen limit, I thought I didn't need that much... but now I'm grateful I had it. You never know what might happen...

So with that, I reset the MacBook Pro and put it back in the box the night of the return request call, and I went to the Yamato Service Center to return the MacBook Pro on the next day, the 18th. Then, I immediately bought the new MacBook Pro.

### The Second Time's the Charm
The new MacBook Pro arrived about a week later on the afternoon of the 26th. Since I couldn't receive it during the day, I thought I'd get it on Saturday the 28th... But when I mentioned it casually, someone told me I could pick it up at a Yamato Service Center within their reception hours. I found out that the MacBook Pro that couldn't be received at home was being held at a service center very close to home.

Thinking I might be able to receive it that day within reception hours, I called Yamato. However, upon calling, I discovered that only packages from Apple (or high-value products from Apple like MacBook Pros) have a special requirement‚Äîto be received directly at home (delivery address).

The final delivery time was between 19:00 to 21:00, and I couldn't return home by 20:00, so I was about to settle on Saturday. But I tried asking if 20:00 or later was possible, and surprisingly, they said, "We'll inform the delivery person to deliver it after 20:00." They agreed to deliver after 20:00, showing great flexibility and service, much appreciated by Yamato üôè

And at around 20:00, I finally received the eagerly awaited new MacBook Pro...!! üéâ

Well, in terms of appearance, it looks the same as the returned previous-generation MacBook Pro üòÖ

### Specs
The specs of the new MacBook Pro I purchased are as follows:

![Specs of the new MacBook Pro purchased](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/full-spec-macbook-pro-2018/new_macbook_pro_spec.png)

As I mentioned earlier, the price was about **400,000 yen**. I couldn't pay in a lump sum, so I set up installment payments. Great stuff is expensive... or rather, Macs are expensive...

![Price of the new MacBook Pro purchased](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/full-spec-macbook-pro-2018/new_macbook_pro_purchase_page.png)

It‚Äôs a full-spec model except SSD is 512GB (the smallest configuration). Since data is managed in the cloud, a large SSD isn't necessary & it doesn‚Äôt significantly affect performance, and upgrading SSD to the max 4TB would add another **300,000 yen**, so I chose the smallest one.

A laptop with **6 cores**...

A laptop with **i9**...

A laptop with **32GB of RAM**...

Isn't it amazing!!? It's no longer about whether you need such high performance; it's simply astounding... It's not about whether you really need such a high-performance device, but rather about the pure allure...!!

On a slightly more serious note, you don‚Äôt want to compromise on things you'll use for many years. Especially since recent Macs don‚Äôt allow adding more memory later, you might regret not going for higher performance and find it too late.

And since I use my computer as a work tool daily, I don‚Äôt want to compromise on it at all. That's why I had no hesitation or doubts about getting a full-spec model from the very start. That's how much I love Macs! (I'm slightly off-topic at the end, but just don‚Äôt worry about it).

With all that said, the new MacBook Pro has safely arrived, and after setting it up and configuring the environment, I am enjoying a comfortable MacBook life.

### Impressions
As for the feel, there‚Äôs almost no difference compared to the returned MacBook Pro. However, the keyboard on the new MacBook Pro has evolved to type quietly, and if you think about it, it does feel less clicky and the typing sound is more pleasant than the previous one. For people who used the older MacBook Pro for several years, maybe this difference is significant.

The experience of high specs? Well, I can‚Äôt really say yet as I've just finished setting up the environment and haven‚Äôt done much work on it üòÖ

I look forward to being able to fully utilize it and perhaps be blown away by its capability.

### In Conclusion
I'm grateful to the colleague who quickly informed me about the new MacBook Pro‚Äôs release üôè

Had I found out a little later, I would have missed the two-week return deadline and wouldn't have been able to return it. And I probably would have been too excited about receiving the MacBook Pro to even notice the news about the new MacBook Pro.

Four days after receiving a previous-generation MacBook Pro, a new one suddenly appeared, and I luckily learned about it before the return period ended and managed to get the new MacBook Pro... Whether it's good luck or bad luck is unclear, but there's one thing I can say to all of you reading this in the end. That is...

**Mac is awesome~**
