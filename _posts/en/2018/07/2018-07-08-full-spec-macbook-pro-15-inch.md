I bought a MacBook Pro along with a [300,000 yen premium domain](https://noraworld.blog/get-noraworld-com/). As I mentioned in the premium domain article, the price was **350,000 yen**. It's the highest spec model currently available.

Here's what the accessories look like.

I thought I'd probably use a USB Type-C to USB and a USB-C to Lightning cable often, so I bought them together with the MacBook Pro.

After it arrived, a colleague pointed out, "If you have USB-C to USB, do you really need USB-C to Lightning?" and I thought, fair point. But having both is convenient, so it turned out okay in the end. (Honestly, I just hadn't realized that yet.)

### Reason for Purchase and Background
Before getting this new MacBook, I had a MacBook Air purchased in 2014. I've been using it lovingly for about 4 years.

In April 2018, I joined a company as a new graduate and was provided with a company MacBook Pro (the latest 13-inch model). Since my MacBook Air was from 4 years ago, I was surprised by the changes over the years when I used the company MacBook Pro.

I was, of course, amazed by the Touch ID and Touch Bar, but what surprised me the most was the improved screen quality. My MacBook Air didn't even have a Retina display, so I was overwhelmed by the screen's finer detail.

Once I started using the company MacBook Pro and then went back to my personal MacBook Air, the screen's coarseness really bothered me, which showed how big the change was.

Even before the company provided me with a MacBook Pro, I had thought a few times about getting a new MacBook since my MacBook Air was still running fine and I wasn't facing any particular issues. So I just kept using it.

I had this feeling that if I were to buy a new MacBook, I’d go for the highest spec model without compromise. I knew that going for the highest specs would cost almost 300,000 yen, which made it difficult to purchase immediately, financially.

However, once people experience something better, they find it hard to go back to their old environment. This case was no different. After continually using the company MacBook Pro, there was no way I could go back to my personal MacBook Air.

Although I could take the company MacBook Pro out, since it's for work, I thought it best to have a personal MacBook too, so I decided to buy one.

Regarding the timing of the purchase, I went for it with the same momentum as when I bought the 300,000 yen premium domain. I figured I'd buy it sooner or later anyway, so why not ride the momentum of the big purchase decision.

I made the payment on Apple’s website on July 1st (Sunday). It arrived exactly one week later, today, on the 8th (Sunday).

### A Minor Incident
Actually, there was a minor incident during the purchase. It might not be so dramatic as to call it a ‘minor incident.’

Since I bought this MacBook Pro right after the premium domain purchase process, it was impossible to pay in full at once. So, I decided on installment payment.

I have a VISA debit card and a Mastercard credit card. Normally, debit cards deduct the amount from your bank account the moment the payment goes through, so they aren’t suited for installments.

However, I wanted to use the debit card that basically gets deducted immediately, and out of mere curiosity, I tried making the payment with the debit card and, surprisingly, it went through...!

Immediately after, I received an email saying the debit had been made, and upon checking, 100 yen had been deducted.

Finding this odd, I contacted Apple’s phone support right away. After explaining the debit card issue and verifying my identity, they quickly checked it out.

Apparently, in Apple's system, it doesn't determine whether the used card is a credit or debit card at the point of purchase; it temporarily processes the purchase with either. However, you can't do installments with a debit card, so when they tried to proceed with the installment from the registered card, it resulted in an error, halting the payment process.

The 100 yen deduction post-purchase was to verify the card’s validity, which would later be refunded. Normally, this process is with a credit card so nothing is deducted from your bank account, but because I used a debit card, it was immediately deducted due to the debit card’s nature. The 100 yen would be refunded after a few months.

Since it sounded like the payment process would error out if things continued, I canceled that payment during that phone call and decided to reorder with a credit card.

If I hadn’t addressed it and the transaction did error out, it would have held things up while they confirmed over the phone, potentially delaying when the product would arrive. I was glad I contacted them swiftly to handle the situation. But honestly, I shouldn’t have thought of trying a debit card for an installment plan...

Apple’s support staff advised ensuring the credit card wasn't over its limit, so I called the credit card company to check the limit before reordering. There weren’t any issues with the credit card limit, so I proceeded with the order again.

The next day, Apple called. Since I paid with a credit card this time, everything should've been fine, so I was a bit uneasy. But the call was just about order and identity confirmation.

Apparently, for high-value purchases like a MacBook, they sometimes check beforehand if the person actually placed the order (making sure it's not an unauthorized transaction) before proceeding with the payment. After confirming, I was able to continue the payment process successfully.

### In Conclusion
So, this is what can happen if you try paying for installments with a debit card out of curiosity—definitely something to be cautious about. Though I doubt many would try it, there is a chance of accidentally using a debit card, so...

Using the new MacBook Pro I received feels absolutely great, to say the least. Of course, I knew it would be since I’d been using the same model for work. However, the work Mac is 13 inches, while the one I bought is 15 inches, so the extra screen real estate makes it even better.

Also, the Apple support staff I talked to were incredibly kind and detailed in their responses, which I really appreciated. It’s just as expected from the renowned Apple. I plan to continue being a devoted Mac user in the future.
