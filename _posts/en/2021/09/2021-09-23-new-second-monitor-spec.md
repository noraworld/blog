The other day, I assembled a standing desk. At that time, I also attached the monitor arm I purchased.

The monitor arm I bought is split into two branches, allowing for the installation of two monitors. However, since I only have one monitor at home, one spot remains vacant. For more details, please refer to [the blog post about assembling my first standing desk](my-first-standing-desk).

Therefore, I'm thinking about purchasing another monitor. It's not merely because I can attach another one to the monitor arm. I've always wanted to have two monitors, and it just so happened that FlexiSpot had a monitor arm for two monitors, so I decided to buy it.

The reason for wanting two monitors is for game streaming. I want to display the game screen on one and keep the PC screen on the other to monitor streaming software and the streaming status.

Currently, the built-in display on my MacBook is sufficient, but in the future, I plan to customize the keyboard and pointing devices (mouse, trackpad, trackball, etc.). This would likely lead to operating my MacBook in clamshell mode. Moreover, I am also considering building a custom PC, so either way, I will need two monitors.

For now, I am managing just fine with the MacBook's built-in display, without any major complaints. So, I thought it might be fine to leave it as it is, but a catalyst emerged for purchasing a monitor.

That is the expiration of my Yodobashi points at the end of this month. The last time I bought something at Yodobashi Camera was about two years ago when I purchased a washer-dryer, and since then I haven't used Yodobashi, not even their online shopping. As a result, the expiration of the points I've accumulated is finally approaching at the end of this month.

When I checked the accumulated points, there were **42,610** points. Losing all these points would definitely be a waste. As mentioned, I've been planning to upgrade various equipment around my desk, so I decided to use the Yodobashi points to purchase another monitor.

### Functional Requirements
When considering the purchase, I summarized the specifications I want for the monitor. Below are the mandatory and optional specifications.

#### Mandatory Specifications
* VESA mount compatible
* Weight: Within 9 kg
* Comes with Remote Control
* Resolution: 4K

#### Optional Specifications
* Size: 27 inches
* Non-glossy
* Night Shift support
* Daisy chain, multi-stream transport compatible
* USB downstream support
* USB power supply

Here, I'll explain why I think each of these specifications would be good.

##### VESA Mount and Weight
Since I'll be attaching it to a monitor arm, it must be VESA mount compatible. Furthermore, each monitor arm I purchased can only hold up to 9 kg, so the monitor must weigh below that to be attached. Therefore, these two are mandatory.

##### Comes with Remote Control
This is a feature I really wanted when buying a new monitor.

To be precise, it doesn't need to be a remote; I'd be happy with a smart monitor that can connect with Siri, but I couldn't find any such monitor from what I searched. There are smart TVs, but perhaps there isn't much demand for a smart monitor.

The reason I want a remote or something that can connect with Siri is that physically pressing buttons to switch input or adjust brightness is cumbersome.

A while ago, I sold my TV on Mercari, but before that, I had a TV at home. Since TVs come with remotes, I registered the remote’s infrared with the SwitchBot Hub and connected it with Siri, allowing me to switch HDMI input via voice or Apple Watch or have it turn off automatically at bedtime.

Having gotten used to this setup, once I sold the TV and switched to using a single monitor, I found it cumbersome to switch inputs and adjust brightness.

Thus, I thought it would be nice to have a similar capability with a monitor. So I was searching for monitors with remotes. By registering the remote's infrared with SwitchBot, I thought I could achieve the same as with the TV.

Besides, if I set up a two-monitor system and the monitor I already have doesn’t have a remote, the convenience wouldn’t improve, I thought. But it's enough to have just one monitor, the one connected with a Fire TV or Nintendo Switch, to be remote-controlled. So, if the new monitor is the one with the remote, at least the input switch would be limited to that monitor only. Also, regarding brightness adjustment, I generally want the screen to dim at night, and the one I use at night will most likely be the one with the Fire TV connected, so I don’t need to worry about the other one.

##### Resolution
This is simply because my eyes are accustomed to 4K. My MacBook has a Retina display, and the monitor I currently use is also 4K. If the new monitor I purchase were to be Full HD, I think I'd struggle with the disparity.

##### Size
I currently have a 27-inch monitor, which feels just right, so I plan to stick with the same size. The TV I had before was 43 inches, and I enjoyed it as a large screen while viewing from a distance, sitting on the TV stand. But for work purposes, especially when considering a monitor for work tasks, a distance is needed, so I can't choose a monitor that's too large.

##### Non-glossy
The built-in display of my MacBook is glossy, but I personally prefer non-glossy displays. Not only are they less tiring on the eyes, but they also don't easily reflect light.

##### Night Shift Support
The monitor I currently own is an LG one. While I haven't tested them all, generally, I get the impression that most LG monitors are compatible with macOS's Night Shift.

When I had a Mac mini connected to a TV I used to own, it didn't support Night Shift. I tried to use a third-party app to simulate Night Shift, but the color tasted just a bit off, which I didn't quite like. I would prefer a monitor compatible with the standard macOS Night Shift, but such official Apple-supported monitors are exceedingly rare, thus making it almost a gamble. However, if I were to buy an Apple-authorized one, the options would be significantly limited.

##### Daisy Chain, Multi-stream Transport Compatibility
First of all, what is a Daisy Chain (Multi-Stream Transport)? It's a system that allows connecting multiple monitors in a series, via a single connection to the PC.

Normally, if you wanted to connect multiple monitors to one PC, you would connect each monitor to the PC with separate cables. However, if you have a monitor that supports daisy chaining, you can connect one of the multiple monitors to the PC, and the rest by connecting the monitors in a series—thereby enabling the use of all monitors.

However, monitors supporting this feature are not yet common and there's a limited variety. And of course, every monitor used in this setup has to be daisy chain compatible. So, unless I replace my current monitor (non-daisy chain compatible) with a new one that supports it, this feature cannot be utilized.

Further complicating matters, apparently macOS doesn’t support daisy chaining. So, even if I could use it, it might only serve when building a custom PC and working on Windows. Given these constraints, I feel it might not be necessary.

##### USB Downstream Support
USB downstream is a feature allowing a monitor to function as if it were part of a PC’s ports when connected to a PC via USB-C. Therefore, when an external keyboard or mouse is connected to the monitor, the PC recognizes them.

For a keyboard or mouse used with a PC, typically direct connection to the PC is necessary. But if the monitor supports USB downstream, connecting them via USB-C will allow the monitor’s USB ports to function as PC ports.

This provides the benefit of using an external keyboard or mouse by simply connecting the Mac to the monitor with one cable, keeping the Mac wiring clean and simple.

However, since I have an eGPU connected to my MacBook, and it functions in such a manner, this is not entirely necessary.

##### USB Power Supply
Recently more monitors are coming with this feature. It provides screen output as well as power or charge the laptop when connected via USB-C.

But as mentioned in the USB downstream section, my MacBook is connected to an eGPU, and the eGPU side supports this feature too, so it’s not mandatory.

### Purchase Option
After researching the above specifications, this is what I am planning to purchase:

[BenQ EW3280U](https://amzn.to/3zz1BBQ)

Though I have posted an Amazon link, I will of course be purchasing from Yodobashi.

I searched for monitors with remote control, but at this point, they are limited in variety. While remote control is standard for TVs, it is rather uncommon for monitors.

Out of the few remote-controlled monitors, I felt this one was good.

It doesn’t support Night Shift, daisy chains, or USB downstream, but it meets all mandatory requirements.

One point of concern is its size. I wanted a 27-inch, but this model is 32-inch. There's another monitor from BenQ, the [EX2780Q](https://amzn.to/3zL1Wl3), which is 27 inches and comes with a remote, but its resolution is WQHD (2K).

After deliberating between size and 4K, I decided to go with 4K.

I found a few other monitors with remote controls, but most had a Full HD resolution or were larger than 40 inches.

Honestly, a 32-inch seems a bit large, but there wasn't any other promising remote-controlled monitor that I came across, and 32 inches seems tolerably close, so I think I might go with this one.

If I purchase it and get to use it, I might write about it on the blog again.
