I bought a standing desk, so I’m documenting the reasons for purchase, assembly, user experience, and more.

### Reason for Purchase
Because of my job, I spend quite a long time working in front of my computer. If it weren’t a standing desk, I’d be sitting all that time.

I recently started using the Pomodoro Technique again, so I stand up during breaks and walk around, meaning I’m not sitting continuously. Still, it’s true I spend most of the day sitting.

It’s said that every hour you sit cuts 22 minutes off your lifespan, so staying in a sitting position constantly isn’t good for your health. Humans, back when they hunted, spent most of their time standing and moving. Sitting isn’t an activity that aligns with our natural state.

However, in modern times, desk work has increased, and spending whole days sitting isn’t unusual. That’s where standing desks come in.

About two years ago, when I used to go to the office, I would use cardboard on my desk for a makeshift standing setup[^1].

[^1]: Around that time, I was also using the Pomodoro Technique.

These days, remote work is the norm, and I almost never go to the office. This means my home workspace is effectively my work environment. Furthermore, I use my computer for hobbies too, so I wanted to set up a productive and comfortable home workspace.

I’d been wanting to get a standing desk for a while, but it seemed like a high hurdle to overcome. Recently, a standing desk was recommended during a casual chat on my company’s Slack, and I finally decided to make the move and purchase one.

### The Standing Desk I Bought
I decided on [FlexiSpot's E8 Bamboo](https://flexispot.jp/e8-bamboo.html).

This is my first time buying a desk, let alone a standing desk[^2], so I wasn’t sure what would be good. I knew IKEA was famous, but I heard FlexiSpot had more experience with standing desks, and there were many YouTube videos introducing FlexiSpot desks, which ultimately led to my decision.

[^2]: When I moved out on my own, I took my desk from home and had been using it since.

I had pretty much decided to buy around August this year, but was undecided on the type. I found out that on September 8th, the new E8 Bamboo model was being released, and I purchased it the day it launched.

Coincidentally, FlexiSpot had a 4th-anniversary sale, lowering the price, which made it the right time to buy.

Along with the desk, I also bought a cable tray and monitor arm.

### Additional Necessary Items
I'll go into detail later, but here’s what I ended up needing.

* [Electric Drill](https://amzn.to/3CszdD3)
    * Torque 130 N·m
    * Voltage 14.4 V
    * **Be cautious if your electric drill's power is lower than this as it might not drill holes in the tabletop (details later).**
* Wood Drill Bits
    * I bought 2.5 mm, but 3.0 mm might have been better.
    * Drill bit sets with various sizes are available and recommended.
* Screwdriver
    * Cross-type (for Phillips screws)
    * Electric or manual (details later).

### Arrival Day
It arrived on September 17th (Friday) around noon. As I had heard, it was very heavy. So heavy that I couldn’t lift and carry it to the living room. I had to drag it across the floor.

![Arrival](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/my-first-standing-desk/arrived.jpg)

I had heard I needed an electric screwdriver, but having never done DIY, I didn’t know what to buy and hadn’t purchased one yet. Although a blog article about assembling this standing desk mentioned needing an electric drill, some colleagues said it wasn’t necessary, leaving me unsure.

Later, I heard from someone who assembled a standing desk that they used [this](https://amzn.to/3hMypB9) electric screwdriver. It came with various screwdriver bits and drill bits, so I thought it would work even if I needed an electric drill. Additionally, someone had actually used it for assembling a standing desk, so I decided to purchase it.

After work, I began a practice assembly.

First, I read the instructions. Having heard that assembling it alone was extremely difficult, I was almost discouraged before starting, but the instructions made it look surprisingly easy.

According to the instructions, there were six steps. The first three could be done with just the included hex wrench, without any additional tools.

Step 4 required a screwdriver, so I thought I’d see how far I could get with a manual screwdriver lying around the house. Surprisingly, it was easy to tighten screws manually.

However, I noticed a problem. I bought the tabletop with the desk, so the holes for screwing in the columns (movable sections) were already there. That wasn't an issue, but there were parts without pre-drilled holes. Specifically, there weren’t any holes for screwing the beam, which allows for lateral width adjustment of the columns according to the tabletop’s width.

It was strange to have pre-drilled holes for the columns and height controller mounts but not for the beam. If you buy the tabletop separately, it’s understandable you’d need to drill holes depending on your specific standing desk setup or other purposes. But why would they need to leave this part of the tabletop, which comes as a set with the desk, for the user to do?

Regardless, complaining wouldn’t solve anything, so I stopped for the day.

### Full-Scale Assembly
The next day, September 18th (Saturday), I started the actual assembly. The electric screwdriver I ordered arrived in the morning, so I dove straight into work. The screwdriver I bought included drill bits, so I decided to drill the holes with it.

Then came a shocking revelation. With the drill bit mounted on the electric screwdriver, I tried drilling into the tabletop, but I couldn’t make a hole, only a surface scratch.

In other words, the electric screwdriver (drill) I bought didn’t have enough power to drill into the tabletop. As a DIY beginner, I wasn’t well-versed, but it seems voltage and torque are key for drills. Checking the specs of the one I purchased on Amazon, it had a voltage of 3.6 V and torque of 6 Nm. It couldn’t drill through.

Reluctant to order and wait for another drill on Amazon, I decided to visit a home improvement store. There was a Konan nearby, so I headed there. Oddly enough, this was my first time visiting a home center since moving to Tokyo. It rained heavily on my way there but stopped afterward.

There were various electric drills and screwdrivers at Konan, and I didn’t know which to buy. I asked a store clerk. He said bamboo was harder than other woods, so a drill with considerable power was necessary. It’s unclear if the drill I bought could drill into other woods, but it might have failed only with bamboo. But I suspected the problem wasn't just the hardness. It seemed the drill was too weak overall. The bit didn’t penetrate—it felt like it just spun on the surface.

I went with the clerk’s recommendation and bought a Makita electric screwdriver. Even as someone who’s not into DIY, I knew Makita was famous for tools. I didn’t plan on repeated use. I just wanted something that accomplished my goal, so I purchased the recommended model.

![Makita Driver](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/my-first-standing-desk/impact_driver.jpg)

This Makita option included a battery, so I didn’t need to buy one separately.

The drill bits on order from Amazon hadn’t been checked for compatibility with the Makita driver, and I didn’t want another store trip, so I bought wood drill bits on this occasion. Since the clerk mentioned bamboo’s hardness means wood bits might not always work, I also bought more robust metal drill bits. To get to the point, wood bits were enough, so I didn’t use the metal ones, but they were inexpensive anyway.

I also bought protective goggles to avoid wood dust flying into my eyes during drilling.

![Bits & Goggles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/my-first-standing-desk/drill_bits.jpg)

Upon returning home, I resumed assembly immediately. Testing the Makita’s rotation speed showed it was markedly faster.

Drilling the required holes, I could finally make holes.

Later, however, another issue arose. After drilling a bit, I tried inserting screws, but they didn’t go in as far compared to factory-drilled holes.

Apparently, the hole diameter was too small. Before heading to Konan, I checked the factory hole diameter, which seemed between 2 mm and 3 mm, so I opted for 2.5 mm drill bits.

However, the bits didn’t have a consistent size from tip to base. They tapered from a sharp tip to a thicker base.

Plus, the holes needed to be about 1 cm deep—far from using the bit’s full length. The actual hole came out smaller than 2.5 mm.

This was unexpected. I wasn’t experienced in such tasks, so I assumed measuring hole diameter was enough.

My bought bits were both 2.5 mm, for wood and metal. I lacked energy to visit Konan again, so I improvised.

By slowly rotating the bit while snug in the hole and scribing around with the spinning bit, I expanded hole diameter, deepening it slightly for good measure. While screws were still tricky to insert, with some force, I could snug them acceptably in.

Yet, one screw's threading got damaged attempting this, slightly splintering the hole area pushing the screw. But since they're unseen, mounting secure, it was acceptable to me.

Drilling was cautioned not to over-penetrate. I marked 1cm depth with masking tape on the bit. It saved over-drilling worry.

Finally, Step 4 completed. Steps 5 and 6 didn’t require drilling, using just a hex wrench, finishing quickly. Challenges mostly came from Step 4.

After upright setting, functional tests concluded.

Now came the monitor arm assembly and attachment, purchased with the base unit.

Clamping and grommet variants exist, and my monitor arm accommodated both.

A clamp attaches by securing with pressure on the top and bottom of a tabletop edge. The grommet method requires drilling a hole in the tabletop to secure a post through for the monitor arm.

Anticipating potential hole-drilling inconvenience pre-purchase, I'd planned on clamping. Exhaustion from assembling the base meant I had none left for grommet method hole-drilling. Besides, grommet setup needed an 8.5 mm to 70 mm hole … (?), impossible with current bits.

Revisiting documentation, I still query the 8.5 mm to 70 mm listing:

![Manual](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/my-first-standing-desk/manual.jpg)

70 mm would be a sizable 7 cm—something seemed off, though it may be valid without my direct testing. A clamp installation it was. It gripped firmly so should suffice.

An angled-edge tabletop inhibits clamping, making grommet necessity—mine fortunately stayed clamp-compatible.

With clamp method, no drilling required, securing only necessary for monitor plate assembly—much simpler than base setup comparably.

Though aware of VESA standard necessity, a lack of pre-check meant confidence solely from inspection of existing monitor’s backplate type for assumption. Actual attachment confirmed compatibility—should verify beforehand!

Successfully assembling and attaching the monitor arm, finalizing placement where previous desk stood, assembly was finished.

![Completion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/my-first-standing-desk/appearance2.jpg)

![Completion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/my-first-standing-desk/appearance3.jpg)

Post-noon start, inclusive of home center venture, cumulatively equated to a full-day assembly endeavor.

### Cleanup
Exhaustion upon assembly completion meant cursory debris collection and sleep sufficed.

The following day, September 19th (Sunday), more thorough cleanup ensued. Though not refuse collection day, amassed items filled the entryway, impressively voluminous; indeed considerable.

![Garbage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/my-first-standing-desk/garbage1.jpg)

![Garbage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/my-first-standing-desk/garbage2.jpg)

Some refuse derived elsewhere, yet in any case, significant waste materialized.

### Cable Tray
The earlier mentioned cable tray purchase remained unrealized due to a defect noticed with the base unit’s arrival. Thickened points needed hex tightening, such tightening yielded a stripped screw, turning freely upon attempts for full connection. Lacking firm retention, simply pulling detached it.

Two mounting locations existed—one secure, the other not. A probable hole defect, it was defective.

For cable tray attachment, say, hole-drilling was required in similar fashion. With the base fully assembled, the inconvenience of reopening for drill work adds reluctance.

Though refund was preferred, uncertainty over FlexiSpot policy's first-time purchase permitting remains.

Initially planned were hidden cable management, adapter concealment under the tabletop. However, tidy transformation waits further ahead.

### Usage Impressions
This blog’s composition began post-cleanup, September 19th (Sunday). While briefly since the assembly, though premature for judicious critique, any immediate thoughts or recognizable patterns noted here.

#### Assembly Difficulty
Acknowledged difficulty proved genuine. Core challenge concentrated on drilling chiefly—his colleagues masked its necessity, hinting model-dependence. Absence-lessened difficulty may characterize.

Inexperience in simple DIY and non-expert hands didn’t preclude assembly; certainly manageable though cumbersome.

##### Drilling and Screws
Pointing out, drills necessitate electric models exclusively—weak power types equally futile. Oddly, screwdriver usage proved unnecessary despite collective endorsement. All screws tightened manually.

Conventionally robust, manually rotated screws inflicted minor hand surface cuts; minimal but signifying firmness exertion.

A drill video’s depicted screw stripping and bending with power tools fueled avoidance from priority caution. Initially attempting manual screwting sufficed.

The matter of personal prerogative whether or not power screwdriver assists. Manual suffices, pragmatic said.

Retreading section—entirely discretionary if electric drill employed depends. Bamboo’s inflexible nature furthers, hence electric drill's practicality.

Electric drill mocks power screwdriver inter-exchangeable. Manual issues relieve switching; no power indenture here.

##### Moving the Base
Unremembered challenges arose when lifting or relocating by rotation.

Totaling near 50 kg across wood and frame, mere repositioning imposes effort. Assembled unit lifting, even bulk-sculptured Herculean likely ill-advised—though risky to back alike.

Careful inversion permits or adequate redirection saps unforeseen energy; vigilance advised.

#### Desk Wobble
Pre-purchase, desk lateral wobble presented apprehension. Prior 4-legged desks assured stability.

Distinctly, dual-column stands invite vibrations whilst typing. With, perhaps standing extended column height compounds wobbliness promoting mounts’ oscillations.

As it stands, tolerance barely incurs remark albeit subject to recalibrations.

#### False Positive Obstacle Detection
The E8 Bamboo integrates collision prevention; undue obstructive ascent instantly halts descent.

Noteworthy, sans blockage, detection initiates arresting—and possibly misfires as theory, nearing programmed end halts induce error-free alignment shortcoming routine. End-align hurdles, micro-adjustments and fixed enter habit—annoying, though manageable.

Three-tier sensitivity scales permit; noted deviations regardless. While OFF negates errors presently unknown, risk excludes ongoing deactivation, preferring lowest sensitivity span.

Well-worth elevating convenience, occasionally thwarted is nuance of repetition.

[Update]

Approximately one week into usage, relocating my external GPU unit from right front to back left resolved misbehavior. Uneven weight distribution appears to instigate misdetections. Heavy devices well-distributed balance, avoiding central placement for harmony.

#### Sound During Adjustment
Adjustment operations emit a “whirring” present at around 55 dB neighboring specific units, equating unobtrusive individual perception preferences—acceptably soothing.

#### Lock Functionality
Unintentional keypad encounters prompted height adjustments—not twice confirmed event prone safety lock prevents inductions, regarded handily optional journey against provocations.

Frequent adjusters operational cautionary measure them ongoing secure stable.

#### Am I Standing?
Technically standing possible notwithstanding that height variable with easy flipping—split evenly leaning toward standing albeit modest usage tenure.

Standing solely supports overarching health benefits within interval flowing, centering session pauses promote exertion balance.

Incorporated Pomodoro intervals involve cursorial circuits conducive equally amid workspace continuity in job-titled affairs.

Concentration realm of benefit, immediate task isolation banishes sprawling eternalities—ambition focused command purges rest contemplations unrivaled.

Once wondered about lifetime standing possibility; perhaps rash. Playfully empowered elevation—practical selection, sequencing position oscillations should persist tensions rotated to mitigate an over proposed uncertainty cascade.

Softer stance commands acknowledgment within gradient frames’ opposed chronicle, notably escalated amidst human ergonomic diversity thresholds.

### Considering Stepper Introduction
Perpetual motion profess diversify contends upon footings Stacker seamless action yields contents exploratory subsequent introduction yields feasible upfront labor toward substantiation.

### What to Do with the Old Desk?
New workspace introduced reconsideration of its predecessor; disposal potential arrived, however, intended storing committed duty ensures sound resolution freedom enacted. Accessibility assists diversified component offices, scanner itemizes’s, plus retrospective addition overturned reviewed rendering of unexpected satisfaction.

Imprintable binders approached, availability ensured boon supports shelf inclusion assets.

### In Conclusion
The latter phase emphasized negativity—much sought revelation attained underway, sentiments evolve nonetheless. Expectancy tasted periodic status permutation.

Longer stand sits trace render navigation potential axles interpolated personal ideal engagements perpetuating eventuality encapsulated.
