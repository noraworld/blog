### Points
* If possible, view the surroundings of the property using Google Maps Street View.
    * If there is a main road or railway nearby, it can easily be excluded from your options.
        * Saves the trouble of going to see it in person.
    * However, it is often not possible to confirm.
        * The Street View update around the property is outdated.
            * The building may not be constructed yet, making it unclear if the location is correct.
        * The exact address of the property is unknown.
            * Sometimes the exact address is not provided.
* Choose properties where the neighbors are less likely to move.
    * While there are many uncertainties about neighbors, if it seems like they move infrequently, it may offer stable living.
    * Specific examples:
        * No apartment buildings nearby.
            * Apartments have very high turnover → Potential for noisy tenants or smokers.
        * No rental properties nearby.
            * Even standalone houses, if rented, have the likelihood of turnover.
            * For properties like A building, B building, and C building, it's common for neighboring buildings to have frequent tenant turnovers.
            * Even if this type is completely separated (not a townhouse), the smell of cigarettes can easily come directly.
            * If neighboring houses are owner-occupied and the owners are non-smokers, the chance of being bothered by cigarette smell is significantly lower.
* It's better if there's space between houses.
    * The farther the distance from the neighboring house, the higher the assurance against noise and smoking.
    * Noise is less likely simply because they are farther apart, and smell from smoking is also harder to reach.
    * However, the more urban the area, the denser it becomes.
        * Tokyo's 23 wards are extremely congested.
        * Areas like Hachioji or those closer to the 23 wards are not as congested but not far apart either.
            * May not offer much hope for avoiding noise or cigarette smell.
        * The further from the 23 wards, the less congested it is, but also less convenient.
* Ultimately, you can't choose a perfect ideal property.
    * There are too many uncertainties, especially concerning neighbors.
        * You won't know if neighbors are noisy or not.
        * You won't know if neighbors smoke or not.
        * Even if it's good when you move in, neighbors may change, for example, due to moving.
* It's better to be able to respond to phone calls.
    * Good properties are a race against time, so whether you can quickly answer a call may determine if you get it.
    * Even if you usually can't immediately answer calls, during the period of deciding the move, try to be available as much as possible.

### Mindset
* Be firm in dealings with real estate agencies.
    * Being shy and unable to ask questions leads to loss and regret.
    * Stick to your convictions even if you feel guilty.
        * If you're considering not choosing good properties just because the real estate person researched various things for you, you're missing out.

### Matters to Confirm
* Ensure the property is not psychologically disadvantageous (stigmatised property).
    * The disclosure from the other side is only about recent incidents, but if you ask, it's not limited to that.
    * Real estate agencies cannot lie when asked.
    * Checklist:
        * Express that you don't want to live in a stigmatised property and won't contract if you know it's stigmatised beforehand.
        * Verify whether there have been no homicide, suicide, etc., from the completion of the building until now.
        * Record the conversation content on your smartphone.
* Whether fiber-optic internet can be installed.
    * It ultimately requires checking by the line construction company for a 100% answer, but asking the real estate agency generally gives an idea.
    * Things to confirm:
        * Can fiber optic be pulled from nearby power lines?
        * Is it possible to lead fiber optic through the air-conditioning duct or behind the phone line?
        * If not, can a small hole be made in the wall for fiber optic installation?
* Whether the facilities seen during viewing are already installed.
    * Confirming this avoids the possibility of assuming something is there when you move in, only to find it's not and needing to buy it.
    * Things to check:
        * Ceiling lights
        * Air conditioning
* Whether a washing machine fits.
    * You won't know without viewing.
    * Apparently, someone with long experience in real estate can tell to some extent from the layout, but amateurs can't.
    * Asking the real estate person before viewing is an option.
    * It's important the washing machine fits in the placement area, but also whether it can be brought in through the front door or living room window.
        * If the gap between the front door or living room window is too narrow, the washing machine might not fit inside.
        * For this, it might not be necessary to view it, but it's necessary to go to the site and check.
            * Street View may not have updated information, making it unclear what the surroundings (entrance and spacing with neighbors) are like.
* Whether it's sunny.
    * Again, you won't know without viewing.
* Whether neighbors smoke (if possible).
    * It's likely not possible to ask (or know even if you ask), but it doesn't hurt to try.
    * It's lucky if it turns out they don't smoke.
* Whether the surrounding environment is not noisy.
    * Just going on the day and time of the viewing won't tell you if the neighboring area is truly quiet.
    * You won't know until you've lived there for a while.
    * However, real estate agents should have a knack or experience in this, so it's worth asking and might give some idea of whether it's quiet or not.
        * No railway tracks nearby.
        * The road adjacent to the property has these characteristics, so car noise is not loud:
            * Narrow
            * Not connected to a main road
            * Not a route to necessary places (usually a different road is used)
        * No parks or open spaces nearby.
        * No children living nearby (no school nearby).
        * Etc.
* Renewal fees, renewal dates, renewal intervals.
    * If renewal fees apply or are high and you're considering moving, the aim is to move before these fees occur.
* Notice period before leaving.
    * Normally it's one month, but some properties require two months.
        * Where I live now is like that.
    * If you have to give two months' notice, there's a high chance of having a period where you're paying double rent.
    * Applying to move out before deciding on a new place saves on rent waste before the actual move-out date.
    * However, you must absolutely decide (to avoid being without an address), leading to easier compromises and potentially choosing an unsatisfactory property.
* Ensure sufficient savings before starting a move.
    * Moving is very costly.
        * Initial cost
            * If the deposit and key money are one month each, the initial cost (future rent × 5) is the norm.
            * If the deposit or key money is 2-3 months, add accordingly.
                * E.g., 1-month deposit, 2-month key money equals future rent × 6.
            * If the move-in date is mid-month, an extra may be added.
                * E.g., moving in mid-December adds up to 5.5 times.
        * Moving fees.
        * Rent before moving.
            * Must consider ongoing rent until the move-out date.
            * Especially with a two-month notice period.
    * Savings of about 1 million yen should suffice.
        * 500,000 yen might not be enough, depending on the rent.
            * With a rent of 100,000 yen, while the initial cost might barely cover, living expenses and moving fees may not be payable.
            
### Things to do after contracting the new place
* Change contracts for utilities:
    * Electricity
        * Same-day setup possible, so no rush.
    * Gas
        * Requires a presence, so notify at least one week before activation.
    * Water
        * Same-day setup possible, so no rush.
    * Fire insurance
        * Not sure about the period, but need to cancel fire insurance for the previous residence.
    * Internet
        * Notify at least one month before the desired activation date.
* Moving company
    * Busy seasons (end of year, new year) are hard to book, so book well in advance.
    * As soon as the contract is decided, it might be good to book immediately.
    * Ensure to move items before the inspection date of the previous residence.
* Transfer the resident registration.
    * Must go to the previous municipality, so handle it before the moving day.
* Forward mail.
* Inform company of address change.
* Change address in various services:
    * Amazon, Uber Eats, etc.
