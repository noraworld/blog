I've been trying out an app called Working Copy. I'm actually writing these very sentences using Working Copy right now.

This is an iOS app that allows you to operate GitHub from your iPhone.

GitHub does have an official app, but you can't edit files, commit, or push with it. If you want to create or edit files on your iPhone, you'll need an alternative app.

I initially thought about developing an app myself, but it seemed like it would take a fair amount of time to make something usable from scratch. If this app allows me to do what I want, I might as well just use it.

Why do I want to operate GitHub from my iPhone? Because I want to update my diary with ease.

I currently have a website for my diary, but I plan to move it to GitHub Pages in the future.

The reason is that I want to make GitHub my master repository. I have a sentimental attachment to the diary service I created from scratch, but if for some reason I'm no longer able to run the server or the data is lost, all my diary data would disappear.

Of course, it's not like GitHub guarantees that data will never be lost, but at least managing a server myself comes with that kind of anxiety.

On the other hand, with hosting on GitHub Pages and managing diary entries on GitHub, there's no need for maintenance, making it unlikely that data will be lost due to my inability to manage it.

I want to consolidate not just my diary, but also my blogs and memos, everything onto GitHub.

The reason I have so much faith in GitHub is that they have launched a project to preserve code for the next 1,000 years.

The idea is that code is a treasure of humanity, and they want to preserve these precious resources for future generations.

While I don't suppose my personal blog or diary will become a precious asset for humanity, if nothing else, according to GitHub's initiative, this blog post will be preserved for posterity.

The idea that what I've written will continue to exist even after I'm gone triggers some primal instinct. I have this peculiar trait where I find it hard to get motivated if I think that what I've written or coded will only last as long as I do.

This train of thought emerged quite spontaneously over the past few years; in the past, I wasn't too much aware of it. But now, I want everything I've created, my words, deeds, life—all of it—to be preserved in some form on the vast sea of the internet.

That's why I want to consolidate my blog and diary data on GitHub. If I can only update it via PC, it loses the ease of access, and maintaining it becomes hard.

I would like to write properly for blogs, so updating via PC is fine, but for the diary, I want to keep it as a daily record, no matter how casually written, so being able to update it easily is crucial.

Of course, my current diary service isn't exactly convenient for updates via smartphone, but that's precisely why I want the ease of updating from an iPhone if I'm going to move the data to GitHub.

I've digressed quite a bit, but this is why I want to manage GitHub actions from my iPhone.

If I were to develop an app myself, it would primarily be for diary updates, involving an interface like that of a memo app that pushes updates to GitHub.

But if I can comfortably update using this Working Copy app, then using it might just be a viable option.

What I'm slightly concerned about at the moment is that when I type out sentences, after a while, it automatically scrolls, hiding part of the latest text at the very bottom. I'd appreciate it if an update could fix this issue.

Instead of giving an overview of Working Copy, this has turned into an explanation of why I want to perform GitHub tasks on my iPhone, but writing down my thoughts like this might not be such a bad idea.

Albeit having used this app for just about 30 minutes so far, from a quick glance, it seems that you can do the full range of Git operations.

Naturally, hard-core coding might be tough on a mobile device compared to a PC, but it's not impossible. However, since it can only perform Git operations, it doesn't seem like you can run programs to verify or debug them.

Considering this, it might not be realistic to code on an iPhone, but for someone like me who just needs to write text and push it, this is plenty. After pushing, GitHub automatically handles the hosting to GitHub Pages, so it's convenient that the update process can be completed with just an iPhone.

However, you can't run scripts to auto-generate YAML headers, so writing the YAML header each time feels a bit cumbersome.

Well, as for the diary, I'm going to prioritize ease of updating and keep things simple, so it shouldn't be a problem.
