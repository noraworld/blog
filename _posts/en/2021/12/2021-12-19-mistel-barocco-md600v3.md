Yesterday, the [Mistel Barocco MD600v3 RGB](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B09HGG7XRG) I ordered on Amazon arrived, so I'd like to introduce it.

I also purchased a trackball, and might introduce it in a separate article if I feel like it. Additionally, I bought a mouse pad and a palm rest. The palm rest is expected to arrive in 4 to 5 days as it seems it's going to be delayed.

### What is the Mistel Barocco MD600v3 RGB?
It's what's known as a split keyboard, allowing you to separate the part you type with your left hand from the part you type with your right hand. This allows you to type in a way that’s easier to see than to explain in words.

As you can see, by separating the left and right, you can type with your shoulder blades spread apart. This reduces the strain on your shoulders, making it comfortable to type for extended periods, which is its biggest feature.

This is what the sides look like.

Here's what the back looks like. Each side has feet to add an incline. You can adjust the angle in two stages.

#### Accessories
Caps Lock and Esc keycaps. The supplied Caps Lock has a step on the right side. As for Esc, I wonder why it's designed this way...

Connection cables. The upper coiled one is USB-C to USB-C, designed to connect the separated keyboard sections. The bottom cable is USB-C to USB-A, used to connect the keyboard to a PC.

#### Others
This isn't included with the keyboard, but is something I ordered together. Since I also bought a trackball this time, I wanted a mat to place them on.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/2021-12-19-mistel-barocco-md600v3/IMG_1655.jpg)

Initially, I thought about going with a plain black one, but since everything around me is monochrome and lacks flair, I decided to choose a colorful design at least for the mouse pad. Usually, focusing on functionality over design, I tend not to choose items with character illustrations like this, but since the performance of mats doesn’t vary much regardless of choice, I figured choosing this once in a while could be a nice change.

There were various types, but I chose one that would arrive at the same time as the keyboard and trackball.

### How to Connect
Connect the left and right keyboards with the coiled USB-C cable, then connect the USB-C to USB-A cable to the PC.

One thing to note is **you need to connect the right keyboard to the PC**. There’s a port on the left side as well, but connecting the PC to this only recognizes the left side. This isn’t a malfunction; it seems to be the specification. I don’t know why it’s designed this way, but as long as you’re aware, the cable is long enough to not pose any issues.

### Can Be Used Without Separating
Though it’s a split keyboard allowing a certain distance (to the extent the connecting cable permits) to be placed, you can also use it attached like a regular keyboard.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/2021-12-19-mistel-barocco-md600v3/IMG_1645.jpg)

The keyboard on the left protrudes exactly at the B key while the one on the right has a recess at the N key. By fitting this protrusion into the recess, you can combine the keyboards. It’s simply sticking together through the shape and not through magnets or anything, but it holds well enough—it doesn’t detach easily. However, it might detach if only one side is lifted, so for safety when moving, it's best to hold both keyboards.

When attached, you can use it with a sensation somewhat akin to a normal keyboard, so if you find that the split type doesn’t suit you, you can still use it just fine without separating it.

### Key Layout is Slightly Unique
This keyboard is available only in a US layout, which slightly differs from a standard US layout. To maximize compactness, some keys have been eliminated to reduce the number of keys.

For example, the top row of function keys does not exist. Additionally, while the Esc key is usually placed on the row with the function keys, this keyboard doesn’t have that row, so the Esc key is placed at the leftmost position on the number row. To input the tilde or backquote usually located here, you hold the Fn key located near the bottom right of the right keyboard while pressing Esc.

There are many functions that can be input in combination with the Fn key, and you enter arrow keys by pressing i, j, k, l while holding the Fn key. In this manner, keys that aren’t physically present can be input in combination with the Fn key.

#### The Absence of Function Keys is Slightly Inconvenient
As mentioned earlier, this keyboard doesn’t have function keys. To input function keys, you press the Fn key together with the keys on the row of number keys. For instance, pressing Fn + 2 acts as the F2 key.

Function keys, honestly, are not something used very frequently. Especially on macOS, they are used seldomly.

However, instead of actually as function keys, they’re often used as media keys. On macOS, for instance, pressing the F8 key allows you to play or pause music. It’s convenient to be able to play music with just a single key press before moving, even with one hand.

Additionally, pressing the F3 key launches Mission Control, and pressing the F4 key brings up Launchpad, both of which are handy.

However, since these keys need to be pressed along with the Fn key, it’s a bit inconvenient.

#### Arrow Keys are Difficult to Press
As mentioned earlier, arrow keys also require the Fn key combination, making them cumbersome to press. If you just want to move the cursor (use arrow keys alone), you can do it with Ctrl + f, b, p, b on macOS, but if you want to use them in combination with the Shift or Command key, it may conflict with another shortcut, sometimes requiring real arrow keys.

Not being able to type arrow keys alone can definitely feel cumbersome.

#### Better than the MD770
Despite the peculiarities in key layout, compared to the [Barocco MD770](https://archisite.co.jp/products/mistel/barocco-md770/) I feel this model is more manageable. The MD770, another split keyboard from the same manufacturer, includes additional keys like Home and End on the far right which may not be necessary. The problematic part is these keys are adjacent to the main keys. Normally, if these keys were present, they would usually be placed a little away from the main keys. However, as the MD770 places these keys adjacent to the main keys, the chances of mistakenly hitting them are higher.

Furthermore, the arrow keys encroach into the right Shift key, making it easier to mistype. You may think you are pressing the Shift key but are actually pressing the arrow key or vice versa, which might occur frequently. Also, because these keys are used relatively often, it could become a source of stress.

In comparison, the MD600v3 purchased this time has reduced the number of keys, increasing combination inputs; however, the physical key layout hasn't become cramped, allowing the possibility of solving many issues through software customization to your preference. But with the MD770's physically unique layout, software alone may not suffice.

This is why I chose the MD600v3 over the MD770. In fact, that's the only reason. While the MD600v3 features backlighting, which is somewhat of a game-centric design, personally, I don't care for backlighting (I've already disabled it as soon as I got it).

### Typing Feel and Sound
This keyboard offers four types of switches to choose from: brown, red, blue, and silent red. Naturally, the switch manufacturer is Cherry MX.

Truth be told, this is my first time actually using a mechanical keyboard. I've lightly touched them at stores, but never actually bought and used one.

Therefore, I’m still unsure of which switch suits me. But, I’m not fond of loud typing sounds, so I opted for the silent red switch.

I knew beforehand that red switches are characterized by their light key touch. It is indeed light, but not so light that it presses just by resting my fingers on it. Personally, among lighter switches, I feel it's the ideal lightness.

Of course, I may prefer something heavier yet, but I have no complaints regarding the typing feel at the moment, so I’ll continue using the silent red switch for some time.

Regarding typing sound, as expected from being labeled "silent", it is quieter. Of course, a strong press will make more noise, but even then, it doesn't clack to an annoying degree, so choosing the silent red switch seems to have been the right choice.

Mechanical keyboards are generally known for their distinctive clacking sound, so considering that, it seems fairly quiet to me.

### Usability
I'll write about my experiences while practicing typing on websites like Sushi Typing and e-Typing. As I’ve been using this keyboard for less than half a day at present, the areas I find inconvenient now might eventually become comfortable with continued use. Keeping that in mind, I’ll summarize my feelings after a few hours of use.

#### Frequent Mistypes of Y and B
As mentioned earlier, while it can be used without being separated, as I purchased a split type, I have been using it separated for a while. In fact, even now, as I write this article, I am doing so with it separated.

I noticed fairly quickly that mistyping occurs frequently with keys around the center. Specifically, there's a lot of mistyping with Y and B.

This happens because I try to press it with a finger of the opposite hand. While Y is on the right, due to my habit, when attached, I often press it with my left hand, pressing an empty space where the T key's right side would be. It’s then that I realize, ah, Y is on the right. The same goes for B, which is on the left, but I am accustomed to pressing it with my right hand, frequently pressing the empty space left of the N with the right hand.

It's hard to tell if this is a matter of "getting used to it" or genuinely "inconvenient", because while central keys can be pressed with either hand, this might cause uneven typing with keys being pressed by a different hand each time. But considering this split type may force finger assignment for proper typing, getting accustomed to it might lead to more comfortable typing over time.

However, I noticed during the Sushi Tsuji game that **certain words might actually increase uneven stress, thus becoming more tiring**.

For instance, with `yuukyuukyuuka`, except for the final A, all keys are pressed by the right hand. For `ikkyuunyuukonn`, all are right-hand keys.

With a non-split keyboard, Y can be pressed with the right hand as well, alleviating the right hand's load and speeding up typing as both hands are in use.

#### Wrist and Shoulder Fatigue
After typing on this keyboard for a while, while my left hand is fine, my right wrist and shoulder became quite tired. This might be attributed to the abundance of right-hand-only words as illustrated earlier. Previously, using other keyboards, my wrists or shoulders rarely became sore, especially only on the right side.

Thus, it seems split keyboards may not always guarantee reducing shoulder strain. Of course, one might gradually get used to it, or implementing a palm rest might help reduce fatigue. Given it’s only been a few hours, it’s hard to say for sure, but this lopsided fatigue is quite concerning.

But really, without having felt previous wrist or shoulder strain with non-split keyboards, why opt for a split keyboard now, I wonder? Mainly, my reasons are as follows:

* To force proper finger usage during typing
* Hoping for potentially more comfortable typing experience in the future
* Pure curiosity about using a keyboard type I haven’t tried before
* Perhaps inflicting shoulder strain unknowingly previously

As of now, there’s more inconvenience than comfort with wrist and shoulder pain, but again with only hours having passed since the purchase, persistence might help overcome these issues. I’ve also ordered a palm rest which hasn’t yet arrived. The palm rest might help reduce wrist and shoulder strain.

If months pass without improvement, I might conclude split keyboards just aren't for me and switch to something like a REALFORCE.

#### Might Have Narrower Key Pitch
Possibly due to unfamiliarity, but typographical errors frequently occur for more reasons than just being split. In fact, even trying attached typing resulted in many typos.

Though the exact cause isn't pinpointed, I feel the key pitch (gap between keys) might be narrower than usual.

While a narrower key pitch makes it more compact, it seems likely that the closeness of the keys increases the probability of accidentally pressing neighboring keys.

It might be that this keyboard isn't particularly narrower, but simply having differing key pitch compared to what I’ve used until now makes it unfamiliar. Again, further usage might provide more clarity.

### Backlight Can Be Turned Off
As mentioned earlier, this keyboard is equipped with a backlight feature.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/2021-12-19-mistel-barocco-md600v3/IMG_1666.jpg)

However, personally, I find no particular merit in the backlight. In fact, when brightly glowing rainbow colors are distracting, I prefer to have it off.

Fortunately, the backlight can be turned off. By pressing the Pn key (right Windows key) near the bottom right of the right keyboard together with the number 5, the whole keyboard lights up in a soft pink. Then, pressing the Pn key along with the number 4 allows you to turn off the backlight entirely.

Information on whether the backlight could be turned off wasn’t readily available online, and frankly, I didn’t know until trying it myself after buying it, but I was fairly confident it must be possible and, as suspected, it was.

### Usable with macOS
According to the [official page](https://www.mistelkeyboard.com/products/807a19ebcb8b2924891d471974d65438), this keyboard only states it’s compatible with Windows. [The MD770 has an explicit mention of macOS compatibility](https://www.mistelkeyboard.com/products/d11cf7a73da49468e2a530b4cf18e76c), but MD600v3 does not. If all keyboards were listed as Windows only, it might simply be untested on macOS perhaps, but with some products listed and some not, there’s a potential concern it might not work with macOS.

Likewise, like finding out if backlighting could be turned off, looking up whether it could be used on macOS yielded no useful results online. Having launched in October 2021, there perhaps is still a lack of information. Given the niche nature of split keyboards, few people review them, and even fewer attempt using them on macOS, likely resulting in little information.

Nevertheless, there’s no cause for worry. It works perfectly on macOS. Moreover, turning the backlight on/off or macro programming is possible solely through hardware (keyboard) eliminating the need for specialized software that might only support Windows. Therefore, as far as I can tell, it can be used without limitations on macOS. It would have been nice if macOS compatibility was specified. Why is it not stated for MD600v3 when it is for MD770?

### Conclusion: Not for Everyone
Reviewing what has been written so far, it seems overwhelmingly negative, a realization I came to. Considering why, I believe this keyboard really boils down to "getting used to it" and "being selective of its user."

Regarding getting used to it, extended use might make it more comfortable; however, being selective of its user is nonnegotiable. Candidly, with my current usage feelings, both aspects seem applicable. Continued use might surmount some difficulties, yet others feel insurmountable purely by getting accustomed to it.

If adapting to its split nature fails, using it attached is an option, yet frankly, the merits of purchasing this keyboard become null when attached. Considering there are countless superior mechanical keyboards in the market if keeping them attached.

Taking into account a bit of learning curve, it is worth continued use; however, if adaptation fails, transitioning to another keyboard readily appears as a future possibility.

#### Undoubtedly a High-End Keyboard
Yet, describing it negatively might impart an impression as though it’s inferior even to cheap keyboards, so let me cover some positives.

Most of what was discussed constituted its distinctive features. However, standing as a general keyboard indicator, it undeniably stands on the high-end tier.

It’s expected at the price of 20,000 yen, yet its typing feel and texture are exceptional. It's compact and stylish, eliminating unnecessary keys aimed at saving space, while also exuding elegance which satisfies ownership desire.

Additionally, the mat black color is appealing. While many cheap keyboards come in black, contrasting them reveals this keyboard's opulence instantly. This matte-black color exudes a sophisticated texture.

The engraved fonts are somewhat rounded, imparting a playful impression. This adds accents to its substantial texture and color and personally aligns with my aesthetic preferences.

To sum up, ignoring the split nature and unique key layout, I believe this keyboard rivals other high-end keyboards in completion level. Yet, failing to acclimate to these two features negates its benefits; loads of other diverse and fantastic keyboards exist if willing to spend this amount.

### Closing Remarks
All things considered, it's quite surprising all this was written merely after using it for a few hours. The real question is, will I truly "get used" to this keyboard moving forward? The remarkable traits of this keyboard tramp over usual conclusions or impressions. Hence, a review on this keyboard should ideally come after a few months of consistent use.
