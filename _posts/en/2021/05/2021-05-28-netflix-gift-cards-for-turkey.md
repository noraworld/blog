※ This article is current as of May 2021. Netflix’s prices, plans, and the country with the lowest price may change in the future.

### A Trick to Lower Netflix Costs
I had never used Netflix before, but a whim made me decide to try subscribing.

Netflix offers three pricing plans: Basic, Standard, and Premium. Even the cheapest Basic plan costs 990 yen per month.

However, I was aware of a trick to reduce the monthly fee for Netflix. The trick is to subscribe in the country with the lowest price.

Netflix has different monthly fees depending on the country. In Japan, even the Basic plan costs 990 yen, but in other countries, it can be cheaper or more expensive.

As of May 2021, Turkey is said to be the country where Netflix is cheapest. You can check the prices in Turkey by switching the country on the “[Plans and Pricing (Japan)](https://help.netflix.com/ja/node/24926/jp)” page to Turkey.

[Plans and Pricing (Turkey)](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926/tr)

As of May 2021, the Basic plan in Turkey is 26.99 TRY. TRY is the currency used in Turkey, known as the Turkish lira. 26.99 Turkish lira is equivalent to 346.07 yen.

In other words, while subscribing in Japan costs 990 yen, it can be used for about 350 yen if you subscribe in Turkey.

However, if you access Netflix from Japan and try to subscribe, you’ll end up subscribing at Japan’s price. That’s where a VPN comes in.

Netflix seems to determine the user’s country based on their IP address. By selecting a Turkey server on a VPN and accessing Netflix with a Turkish IP address, you can use Netflix from Turkey. Subscribing from there allows you to pay at Turkey’s price.

### Partnered Cards Are Countered by Netflix
However, there’s one problem. Due to the increasing number of users subscribing from countries different from where they actually reside (cheaper countries), Netflix seems to have implemented countermeasures in 2019.

Even if you disguise your IP address to appear overseas using a VPN, your Japanese-issued credit card might be rejected when registering for payment.

Cards issued by banks or credit card companies are called partnered cards, and their card numbers include numbers that indicate the country. For example, credit cards issued by Japanese banks (like Mitsubishi UFJ Bank or Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation) or Japanese credit card companies are identifiable as Japanese credit cards based on their card numbers.

It seems that Netflix currently checks the issuing country of a credit card when making payments. If you’re accessing from Turkey but using a Japanese credit card for payment, it won’t be accepted. Though I haven’t tried it myself, based on a few online articles, it appears that Japanese credit cards won’t work.

### Proprietary Cards Can Be Used for Overseas Payments
However, there’s another trick. It involves using an international standard proprietary card instead of a partnered card.

The partnered cards explained earlier are not issued by card brands (such as VISA or Mastercard) but are issued by banks or credit card companies, allowing country identification through the card number.

However, there are credit cards issued directly by card brands, not by banks or credit card companies. These are known as proprietary cards.

Card brands issuing proprietary cards include American Express, Diners Club, JCB, etc. VISA and Mastercard do not issue proprietary cards.

So, there are cards like the [American Express Card](https://www.americanexpress.com/jp/credit-cards/green-card/) issued by American Express or the [Diners Club Card](https://www.diners.co.jp/ja/cardlineup/dinersclubcard.html) issued by Diners Club.

These internationally issued cards do not allow country identification based on the card number, meaning they can be used for payments when accessing Netflix from another country using a VPN.

### High Annual Fees Are a Problem
Certainly, with a proprietary card, Netflix payments can be made at the lowest country’s rate (currently Turkey). However, the issue is the annual fee for these credit cards.

In the case of American Express, checking their [card lineup](https://www.americanexpress.com/jp/credit-cards/all-cards/) shows the cheapest annual fee is 7,700 yen for the [ANA American Express Card](https://www.americanexpress.com/jp/credit-cards/ana-classic-card/). For Diners Club, even the cheapest option costs 24,200 yen.

Even if you manage to subscribe to Netflix at a discount, if the required credit card’s annual fee is high, it defeats the purpose.

Calculating the difference between subscribing in Japan and in currently cheapest Turkey results in the following:

* Basic plan: (990 yen - 346 yen) × 12 months = 7,728 yen savings
* Standard plan: (1,490 yen - 524 yen) × 12 months = 11,592 yen savings
* Premium plan: (1,980 yen - 704 yen) × 12 months = 15,312 yen savings

※ Calculated at the exchange rate as of May 2021

For the Basic plan, the Turkish pricing offers an annual saving of 7,728 yen over Japanese pricing, but with American Express’s minimum annual fee of 7,700 yen, it's effectively just a 28 yen benefit. In the case of the Premium plan, the difference is 15,312 yen - 7,700 yen, which might make it worth it with a 7,612 yen annual saving.

The Turkish price (monthly) plus 1/12 of American Express's annual fee (monthly conversion) is as follows:

* Basic plan: 346 yen + 642 yen = 988 yen (2 yen saving)
* Standard plan: 524 yen + 642 yen = 1,166 yen (324 yen saving)
* Premium plan: 704 yen + 642 yen = 1,346 yen (634 yen saving)

All plans are cheaper than the price paid in Japan, but the Basic plan offers only a 2 yen monthly saving, making it marginal. It’s fine if you already have a proprietary card, but if not, you'd end up applying for a credit card solely for Netflix, and if you eventually stop watching and cancel it, you might even lose out on the annual fee.

If you are committed to watching Netflix perpetually (and not canceling), that's one thing, but if there's a chance you might stop and cancel, it could be a riskier option. While subscribing and canceling Netflix is easy, applying and canceling a credit card is not so straightforward.

### Credit Card Brands Usable in Turkey
In my earlier explanations, I hadn’t covered JCB. So I looked into the annual fees for JCB proprietary cards.

I found that JCB offers credit cards with no annual fees.

[JCB CARD W / JCB CARD W plus L](https://www.jcb.co.jp/ordercard/kojin_card/os_card_w.html)

With these, you could theoretically subscribe to Netflix at the lowest price without the disadvantage of a high credit card annual fee.

However, I overlooked something important. As you might have guessed, JCB cards cannot be used on Turkish Netflix.

Looking at the supported credit card brands in Japan shows JCB cards are usable.

However, JCB cards cannot be used in Turkey.

[How to pay for Netflix](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/116380/tr)

The credit card brands accepted for use with Turkish Netflix are as follows:

* VISA
* MasterCard
* American Express
* Maestro
* Troy credit cards

There are no proprietary cards for VISA, MasterCard, or Maestro.

I hadn’t figured out what Troy credit cards were, so I researched and found it’s a payment method used exclusively in Turkey. It appears users can choose from debit cards, credit cards, and prepaid-style debit cards.

Although it’s unclear whether this is a proprietary card, since it’s only used in Turkey, it likely requires residing domestically in Turkey to obtain. Unlike solutions that can be completed online, physical card receipt is necessary.

Therefore, the remaining card brand option is American Express. That’s why I didn’t include JCB in the previous comparisons.

### Is the Gift Card the Only Option?
The remaining option is using a gift card. Netflix gift cards are available as a payment method besides credit cards.

[Netflix Prepaid & Gift Cards](https://help.netflix.com/ja/node/32950)

However, these need to be Turkish-issued gift cards instead of Japan-issued ones.

[Looking to subscribe to Netflix cheaply using a foreign VPN](https://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.jp/qa/question_detail/q12241917197)

Turkish gift cards can be purchased on the following site.

[Netflix Turkey Gift Cards](https://www.g2a.com/category/gift-cards-c6?query=Netflix%20turkey)

This means you can truly utilize Netflix at the lowest price without having to pay for an American Express annual fee.

However, as these are gift cards, they do not allow for automatic renewals like credit cards. Once the balance runs out, you have to purchase Turkish gift cards each time.

Buying cards every time might be bothersome, and if you buy too many at once in a rush, you could lose out if you stop watching Netflix or if Turkish prices rocket. Note that gift cards cannot be converted back to yen (cash), so you should buy them wisely.

### Still Possible if you Registered Before the Countermeasures
If you started subscribing in the cheapest country before Netflix implemented measures to block based on credit card country issuance, you could still use Japanese credit cards after the measures.

However, credit cards have expiration dates, so it’s unclear whether a Japanese credit card can still be used upon expiry renewal if Netflix is subscribed with such a method.

Nevertheless, credit cards typically have an expiration of five years or more, so those who managed to pull off this trick before Netflix implemented these measures can consider themselves lucky.

### Summary
To summarize, it’s as follows:

* Using a credit card from Turkey requires a proprietary American Express card
  * It entails a minimum annual fee of 7,700 yen
* Subscribing from Turkey with a gift card requires purchasing a Turkish-issued gift card
  * Pay attention to the inability to automatically renew and the non-refundable nature of gift cards
* Japanese credit cards can still work if the method was started before Netflix took countermeasures
  * Yet, it's uncertain what happens when the credit card expires

Incidentally, I have not yet subscribed, but I plan to reconsider whether I really want to use Netflix.

If I do subscribe, I might aim for the cheapest option using gift cards. Since I'm unsure about continuing the subscription perpetually (as I might cancel if I stop watching), I find applying for a new credit card with a 7,700 yen annual fee solely for this purpose quite risky.
