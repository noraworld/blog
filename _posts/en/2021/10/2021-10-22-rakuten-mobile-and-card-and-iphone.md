On Friday, October 22, 2021, I signed up for Rakuten Mobile and Rakuten Card at the same time and also purchased an iPhone 13 Pro in the process.



### The Trigger
Embarrassingly, even now as a working adult, my parents are still paying for my iPhone carrier charges.

They have been paying since my student days, and it just sort of went on without change.

However, as I couldn't let them keep paying indefinitely, I decided to switch to Rakuten Mobile via MNP and start paying my carrier charges myself. Technically, it will be considered a "switch," but in the sense of me paying the charges myself, it's like my first contract.

### Reason for Switching
There was also the option of simply changing the payment to myself for the current line I was using, but I didn't even consider that for a moment. This is because my current line is with au (not UQ mobile or Povo), and I knew how exorbitantly high the carrier fees of the three major carriers (excluding things like ahamo and Povo) are.

Incidentally, I just checked, and my payment this month was 6,206 yen. There was no avoiding the feeling that I should be paying this myself, so I finally made up my mind.

### Why I Chose Rakuten Mobile
The payments for the three major carriers were out of the question, so the question was where to sign up. I had done a little research about six months ago and concluded that Rakuten Mobile was the best option.

With Rakuten Mobile, if the monthly usage is less than 1 GB, the fee is 0 yen.

https://network.mobile.rakuten.co.jp

When I checked my usage, it was only 0.1 GB. I'm quite a shut-in by nature, and these days, I barely go outside. So, 1 GB is more than sufficient.

Recently, Povo 2.0 was introduced, and it offers a basic fee of 0 yen with affordable plans available as add-ons.

However, I still judged Rakuten Mobile to be more cost-effective and decided on Rakuten Mobile.

### Rakuten Card Contract
The first step was starting with the Rakuten Card contract.

When I was about to sign up for Rakuten Mobile, there was a campaign where you could earn up to 10,000 points if you applied for and opened a Rakuten Card or Rakuten Bank account at the same time.

https://network.mobile.rakuten.co.jp/guide/application/card-bank-campaign/

Opening a new bank account means having to keep funds there when using it, which disperses your money and complicates management. It could also lead to the hassle of not being able to pay due to insufficient balance, so I decided to pass on the Rakuten Bank.

However, for the Rakuten Card, the usual model has no annual fee, and it also has a Rakuten Point Card feature, which I might use in the future, so I decided to go ahead and sign up. At this point, my decision was quite casual, but I later realized it was the right call.

There was nothing particularly difficult about applying for the Rakuten Card. It was just a matter of filling in the required information.

Moreover, the review process was quick. After completing the required information, I waited for a few seconds, and then the approval notification arrived, and I proceeded to the Rakuten Mobile contract screen.

### MNP Reservation Application
I moved on to entering the necessary information for Rakuten Mobile, but, naturally, if you're going to do an MNP, you first have to arrange an MNP reservation.

https://network.mobile.rakuten.co.jp/guide/mnp/

So, as per the instructions, I called the au customer service to apply for the reservation.

During the application, I received some guidance on points to be cautious of.

#### Validity Period
There is a validity period for MNP, which is apparently valid for 15 days from application.

However, according to what I saw on the screen where you enter the MNP reservation number and validity period for Rakuten Mobile, the validity needs to be at least 7 days remaining, so it's better to proceed with the new line contract as soon as possible after making the MNP reservation.

#### Unlocking SIM Lock
If you're switching lines while using the same device without a hardware upgrade, you'll need to unlock the SIM lock.

Luckily, as of October 2021, it's finally mandatory to sell phones without carrier SIM locks in Japan.

I was informed that unlocking the SIM can be done easily through my au's page. I already knew this from my research yesterday. In-store procedures apparently cost 3,300 yen.

Even if you're upgrading your phone, if you plan to sell your old device on platforms like Mercari, it's advisable to unlock the SIM. Either way, unlocking the SIM seems like a good move.

Apparently, the SIM unlocking deadline isn’t set in stone, but I’ve heard that if too much time passes after terminating the previous contract (au), you might be unable to unlock it later. So, it's probably wise to do it before the new line becomes active.

#### Cancellation Fee
It apparently costs 3,300 yen and will be added to this month's bill.

It seems between February and April this year was the timing for contract renewal. I would have considered switching to Rakuten Mobile at that point, but it seems that at the time, Rakuten Mobile didn’t officially support iPhones, or at least only the relatively newer models had compatibility confirmed. My iPhone 7 didn’t seem straightforward to use, so I was hesitant.

However, recently it seems they’ve formally supported iPhones, and iPhone 7 is listed, so that’s good. I wasn’t planning on waiting until February to April 2023 anyway.

#### No Pro-Rata Calculations
It seems au does not offer pro-rata billing calculations, so the charges for the month will still accumulate as usual. For example, if you cancel on November 1, the charges for November still apply.

#### No Plan or Phone Changes Allowed
As soon as you apply for an MNP reservation, you can't apply for plan changes or phone upgrades with your current au plan. However, SIM unlocking is possible, which is good.

#### Phone Number Only
With MNP, only the phone number is carried over, not the au email address (e.g., `***@au.com`), which will disappear. This is the main reason I don’t want to use carrier email addresses.

#### Auto-Termination Timing
The au contract is apparently automatically terminated when the new line (Rakuten Mobile) becomes active (when the new SIM or phone is delivered to your home).

I was curious how au would know the new line is active, so I asked, but the operator was kind of vague. It seems like they weren't exactly sure either. Well, they said it would automatically terminate, so I suppose that’s how it works.

#### Promotion for UQ mobile and Povo
Before finalizing the MNP reservation, I received promotional information telling me about affordable plans available through UQ mobile and Povo.

Even though I had already set my mind on Rakuten Mobile at this point, I thought maybe there was some information I wasn’t aware of that might make them a better choice, so I listened to what they had to say.

The conclusion: I still came to the decision that Rakuten Mobile was the better choice.

##### UQ mobile
UQ mobile's cheapest plan offers 3 GB/month, it seems.

The usual price is 1,628 yen, but apparently, I qualify for a discount, so it would be 990 yen for me.

When I asked why I qualify for a discount, they said it’s because I'm enrolled in a plan that enables me to use au Hikari.

I had no intention of subscribing to such a plan, but it seems that my parents had, and that's why it was applied to my line as well.

In essence, my parents’ contract with au Hikari results in cheaper UQ Mobile rates for me, but for someone who uses only 0.1 GB, 3 GB is excessive.

If it costs 990 yen for 3 GB, then Rakuten Mobile's 0 yen for less than 1 GB is clearly better.

In addition, it appears that 2 GB would be added for a year if switching to UQ mobile. Meaning, 5 GB. Nope, not needed.

##### Povo 2.0
I got the info about UQ mobile from the representative, but there’s no desk for Povo, so I had to look it up on my own.

As mentioned earlier, Povo 2.0 has a basic plan of 0 yen, and it seems you can add plans as needed.

The cheapest is 1 GB for 390 yen, but that price is per week, not per month.

Converting to a monthly price, that’s 1,560 yen, so Rakuten Mobile really is the better option.

Additionally, since Povo 2.0 likely requires manual topping up when you run low, it seems like a hassle.

##### Contract Continuity
Upon inquiry, it seems my current au contract has lasted for **10 years and 8 months**. Losing that contractual continuity feels a little regrettable.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noraworld/blog-content/main/rakuten-mobile-and-card-and-iphone/IMG_0467.jpg)

If the contracts with UQ mobile or Povo, which are under the same KDDI umbrella, allowed the transfer of this continuity, the \"don't waste\" mentality might have swayed me.

However, that concern was unnecessary.

The contract continuity is only valid with au, and it cannot be carried over to UQ mobile or Povo even though they belong to the same group.

Of course, I have no intention of continuing to pay au’s high fees, so, in a sense, I was able to cleanly let go of this contract continuity.

---

After comparing UQ mobile and Povo’s rate structures, and encountering no challenge to my decision for Rakuten Mobile, I called the number again and completed the MNP reservation process.

I got the reservation number and expiration date over the phone. I just had to enter this on Rakuten Mobile's side.

### Rakuten Mobile iPhone Upgrade Program
Although I just had to make a phone application, considering UQ mobile and Povo lengthened the process unexpectedly.

But, another decision point arose: the Rakuten Mobile iPhone Upgrade Program.

https://network.mobile.rakuten.co.jp/service/iphone/upgrade-program/

It's a plan wherein you can purchase an iPhone on installment through Rakuten, but it had a unique feature unlike any other offers.

It allows you to pay via a 48-month installment; if you pay the first 24 installments (2 years) and return the iPhone, **you don't have to pay the remaining 24 installments (another 2 years)**. In other words, **you can effectively use the iPhone at half the price**.

Although it's written as \"return,\" you can apply the same process to another new iPhone, allowing you to upgrade to a new iPhone every two years. And you only have to pay half the price.

This has a condition that a Rakuten Card is mandatory. This is why I mentioned earlier that signing up for the Rakuten Card turned out to be the right call.

Of course, you can still purchase an iPhone via Rakuten without the Rakuten Card. However, you can only do up to a 24-installment plan in that case.

Additionally, if you purchase using any card other than the Rakuten Card and opt for installments, there will be a handling fee.

With Apple, you can opt for interest-free installment payments, so frankly, there’s no merit in buying an iPhone from Rakuten without a Rakuten Card.

However, if it's through the Rakuten Card, it's a different story. Apple also offers interest-free installments, but they won’t effectively be half-priced. It's an advantageous offer because it ends up half-priced.

At this point, I was a bit swaying, but frankly, I don't use smartphones that much, so the current iPhone 7 was more than enough. I wasn’t particularly interested in having a new iPhone, quite frankly.

However, adding to this, I saw they offered a 20,000 point bonus if switched via MNP to Rakuten Mobile.

At that point, I thought I had to buy a new iPhone and opted to go for a hardware upgrade through this program.

#### The Chosen One was iPhone 13 Pro
I chose the iPhone 13 Pro as the device. If I was buying, I figured I should get the one with better performance. But, the iPhone 13 Pro Max might be cumbersome due to its size.

My current phone is an iPhone 7, which I've used for almost 5 years[^1], and I had no real intention of upgrading, so I hadn't kept up with iPhones lately.

[^1]: When I checked the purchase date, it was January 4, 2017, so precisely, it's about 4 years and 10 months.

But, since I was buying, I looked into it and found that iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max have almost no performance differences. Only the Pro Max has a better battery life.

So I thought the iPhone 13 Pro would be fine, and went with the iPhone 13 Pro.

My only real desire to use a new iPhone was because of its dramatically improved camera features. Moving from an iPhone 7 to a 13 Pro should vastly enhance the camera performance.

I do take a fair number of photos, so it's indeed an advantage that memories in the form of pictures can be taken beautifully. As for other features, to be fair, I don't really care. I'm not someone who constantly fiddles with my phone.

##### Storage
I chose the smallest option, 128 GB. My current iPhone 7 is 256 GB, but reviewing the usage, I had used 49 GB. Almost 5 years into ownership and only 49 GB used. So 128 GB is clearly enough.

##### Color
I chose Graphite. It looked chic and cool in the images. I didn’t overthink this one, just made a quick decision based on intuition.

##### Accessories
I purchased a screen protector and a case together. There's a clear reason for this.

As I elaborated previously, the Rakuten Mobile iPhone Upgrade Program indeed exempts you from paying for future fees upon return after two years, but they charge you a repair fee if the screen is cracked or it is damaged.

So, like before, I decided to have a case and protector on it.

Even disregarding this program, I plan to sell old iPhone models, so keeping them with a case and protector covers that I should fetch a better price when I sell. It should be worth it.

### Rakuten Mobile Contract
This turned out quite long, but I finally entered into the Rakuten Mobile contract, which was the original intent. Or rather, purchasing the iPhone via the Rakuten Mobile iPhone Upgrade Program and the Rakuten Mobile subscription was done on the same page simultaneously.

Because the MNP reservation was done, the essential preparatory steps were complete. Just needed to fill in the necessary information.

After the final screen's confirmation steps, the process somehow failed. But once I tinkered with the final input screen options and opted not to use the Rakuten Points, it completed successfully.

The points in question are the ones that appeared immediately after completing the Rakuten Card agreement. There were notices that mentioned that Rakuten Points could not be used when opting for installments through the Rakuten Mobile iPhone Upgrade Program, likely what caused the issue. I had checked using points for the case and film charges (they are to be paid in lump sum), but that seemed unacceptable.

It had been quite the ordeal leading up to this, but finally, I had completed the procedures for the Rakuten Card, iPhone purchase, and Rakuten Mobile subscription.

Now, it's just a matter of waiting for the arrival of the Rakuten Card, iPhone 13 Pro, and SIM.

#### Concerning the Delivery of the iPhone 13 Pro
Speaking of the iPhone 13 Pro I bought, whether it’s because of high demand or short supply, it was listed as "unknown arrival date." So it’s unknown when it will arrive.

It would be a problem if it's too delayed, but I’m not exactly anticipating the arrival of the iPhone 13 Pro to begin with, so I will just wait patiently.

More than that, there's a much stronger feeling of not wanting to miss out on receiving a large number of Rakuten Points, so I hurried and wanted to complete all the processes swiftly. Here, "processes" refer to actions needed for acquiring Rakuten Points. It requires downloading an app called Rakuten Link and making a call for over 10 seconds as one of the conditions for obtaining points, among other things.

The SIM card might arrive before the iPhone 13 Pro? If that's the case, the new line should be compatible with my current iPhone 7, allowing me to meet those conditions in advance.

In that sense, it may have been good to opt for a physical SIM rather than eSIM. iPhone 13 Pro supports both a traditional SIM and eSIM, and I saw a confirmation dialogue about not choosing eSIM twice. Perhaps they want to push for it since it’s new tech, but eSIM is integrated into the device, and I encountered an article mentioning the hassle of it if switching carriers again later, so I kept it at SIM like before. Actually, if it were eSIM, I couldn’t use the new line until the device arrived, and if the arrival is significantly delayed, what do they plan to do? Does that imply it won’t be delayed that much? Not sure.

### SIM Lock Unlocking
After completing the Rakuten Mobile contract, I thought I’d take a brief break and then also proceed to unlock the SIM lock, but the reception hours were between 9:00 am – 9:30 pm. At that moment, it was already 9:38 pm, so I couldn’t initiate the process. I'll get to this tomorrow. Apparently, the process itself is very simple, involving logging into my au, clicking through the screens, and entering the necessary info.

https://k-tai-iosys.com/guide/simlock_au.php

Convenience has come a long way. Then again, SIM locking was an outdated anomaly, to begin with.

Incidentally, the SIM lock was firmly in place. Well, considering this iPhone 7 has been in use since January 2017, and of course, it was acquired from au, it was no surprise.

#### Additional Note
The next day, I went ahead and undertook the process to unlock the SIM lock promptly. By just following the steps, I managed to complete the process smoothly.

After completion, I checked using the setup app as per the screen capture above, and it still displayed the presence of a SIM lock.

It’s presumably that until either a new SIM card is installed and activated, or the iPhone is reset, it won’t update.

https://support.apple.com/ja-jp/HT201328

Since there’s no immediate need to reset the iPhone, I decided to wait until the new SIM card from Rakuten arrives.
