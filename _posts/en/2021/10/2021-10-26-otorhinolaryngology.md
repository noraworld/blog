I took a summer vacation today. I went to the hospital because I had a discomfort in my throat.

### Background
In fact, the discomfort in my throat didn't just start recently; it's something I've had since I was in high school. I once went to an otorhinolaryngologist back then, but ultimately, they couldn't find the cause, and the symptoms didn't improve as I became an adult.

The discomfort isn't something I experience every day, but it never gets better either. Sometimes it's really noticeable, and other times it doesn't bother me at all.

Recently, however, the discomfort has been significantly prominent, and because it hasn't subsided, I got a bit scared thinking it might be a sign of a serious illness, so I decided to see a doctor.

### Same-day Appointment
The hospital I went to today only allows same-day appointments. I woke up around 8 AM and made an appointment for 10 AM. I didn't want to deal with crowds, so I actually wanted to schedule a few days in advance, but fortunately, it wasn't busy, so that was good. Well, I did call in advance to check and confirm that it wouldn't be crowded.

### Symptoms
The discomfort in my throat feels like something is stuck there. There is rarely any pain, but sometimes there's slight pain or I feel something clearly getting caught in my throat when I swallow.

Additionally, I often have phlegm. There are days when it doesn't bother me, but recently, it's been bothersome more often. Especially right after waking up, even water doesn't go down my throat smoothly.

### Diagnosis Result
The diagnosis revealed that there's no particular illness but that I have severe allergies. It was also noted that there's inflammation inside my nose.

Apparently, the phlegm is caused by the allergies and nasal inflammation, and that's what's causing the sensation of something being stuck in my throat.

Considering the obvious discomfort in my throat, in a way, I kind of wished there was something there that could be removed to clear it up, but I'm also relieved that it's not due to an illness.

These kinds of issues tend to make me constantly worried, fearing it might be polyps or cancer.

As for why I hadn't gone to the hospital until now, there's really no significant reason.

* I don't really like hospitals
    * It's more about the atmosphere
    * I'm bad with the fear of tests
* I lacked courage
    * Anxiety about what if it was a serious disease
* Simply found it bothersome

The dislike for hospitals might be the biggest reason. I'm very uncomfortable with painful or nauseating tests. I would avoid injections if I could.

But to clear my mind, I've decided to get checked as soon as I feel something's off.

### Examination Details
They used a thin camera inserted through the nostril to examine the inside of my throat.

Before that, something disinfectant-like was sprayed into my nostrils, and I already felt a bit uneasy at that point. The medicinal smell spread through my nose, making me feel slightly queasy.

Then, they inserted the camera into my nose. There was no pain at all, but it did feel a bit unpleasant having something inserted into my nose.

However, after the camera reached my throat, the discomfort of having something in there was more intense. Though I didn't feel nauseous, the discomfort running from the nose to the throat was a bit tough to handle.

Initially, I closed my eyes and tensed up, but the nurse advised me to open my eyes, focus on a distant point, and breathe slowly through my nose, which made me feel a bit better.

Nonetheless, I thought it's a test I'd rather not undergo too often.

### Prescription
I was prescribed two types of tablets and nasal spray. These are medications to relieve the symptoms of rhinitis and to help discharge the mucus accumulated due to rhinitis. I'll be taking the tablets for two weeks and using the nasal spray until it runs out.

I was instructed to take them once each, morning, noon, and night. When I asked what to do if I skip breakfast, they advised taking the medication regardless at the same time.

I was told early morning, around 6 to 9 AM, would be ideal, but I'm not always awake at that time. I often wake up late. However, they said it's okay as long as there's an interval of about 4 to 5 hours, so I just need to take the morning dose after waking up and adjust the intervals accordingly.

Apparently, it's due to chronic allergies and inflammation, so it's not something that will completely heal. I was told to monitor the condition for two weeks while taking the medication.

If my symptoms ease, the problem was likely due to allergies or inflammation. However, I can't help feeling that the condition might return once I stop taking the medication.

While a fundamental solution seems challenging, it might be best to improve ventilation, take in fresh air, and try not to worsen the allergies or inflammation as much as possible.

Getting an air purifier could also be a good idea. Incidentally, I left the air conditioner on until mid-October to lower the room's humidity, which made my electric bill high. So, if there's an air purifier with dehumidifying and humidifying functions, I'd like to get it.

### If Symptoms Do Not Improve
While the current examination showed no problems with my throat, if the symptoms don't improve even after taking medication, I've heard it might be good to undergo an endoscopy to examine deeper areas.

Given where the symptoms occur, it doesn't seem like a problem that far back in the throat. However, sometimes stomach acid reaching up into the throat can cause the sensation. If that were the case, frequent heartburn or belching might occur, but it's not applicable here, so it's probably fine.

If you're really concerned, it's good to get checked with an endoscope at an internal medicine or gastroenterology department. Especially hospitals that specialize in endoscopies are preferable.

### Future Measures
For now, I'll take the medication for two weeks and monitor the situation. If it doesn't improve..., I'll think about it then.

By the way, the medication is just enough for two weeks, and it was a bit awkward timing for taking this morning's dose, so I'll start taking it from tomorrow.

### Aside: Bought a Cake
After leaving the hospital and getting my medication at a nearby pharmacy, I bought a cake from a cake shop next to the pharmacy. It's been a really long time since I last had cake.
