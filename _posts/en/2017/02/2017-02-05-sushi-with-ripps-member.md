I went to eat sushi in Kyoto with two juniors from Ripps (the app development circle I was part of last year).

One of them I met at another Ripps gathering at the end of last year, but the other I hadn't seen in about 10 months since he lives in Tokyo. Although he denied it, I felt like his vibe had changed since our last meeting (in a good way, of course).

Sushi is always delicious no matter when you eat itüòä

At the end of January, I had exams and it was tough, so it was nice to finally relax.

### Talk
My juniors are making web and iPhone apps, so our conversation was mainly about tech topics. I'm also into web stuff, so it was fun to hear about recent web trends and new technologies.

I was genuinely impressed by how actively they participate in OSS projects, talking about things like how a pull request they submitted got merged, or how they became collaborators on an OSS where development was stalling due to the developers being busy.

Also, both of them write code for work through side jobs and they seemed more technically proficient than when we were meeting up as Ripps. 

As for me, I'm not writing code for work right now‚Äîit's just a hobby for me. There are lots of codes I'd like to write personally, but since the spring break is almost two months long, I feel like it would be a waste to spend all that time just on coding, so I want to start a tech-related job or apply for an internship.

Talking about technology with people in the IT field is not only fun, but it also serves as an encouragement or a chance to try new things, so I really enjoy it. It's hard to meet and talk often, but if I have the chance, I want to go out to eat and chat about tech somewhere in the future.
