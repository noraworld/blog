Today, March 24th (Friday), was the day to receive our course guidance and grade report. Before I knew it, three years have passed, and there's only one year left of my university life.

Exactly one year ago, I posted an article titled "[I Went to Receive My Grade Report](https://noraworld.blog/2nd-grade-2nd-semester-record/)," and feeling sentimental, I decided to ~~pick up the pen~~ start typing again, just like last year.

### Reflecting on My Third Year
In my third year, I think I was quite unmotivated when it came to university studies. Now, I want to look back at my third year focusing on credit acquisition.

#### Immersed in Hobbies
Before the third-year classes began, during the spring break (exactly one year ago), I first touched a server, created a Chrome extension, and then started to take interest in website creation. I soon ventured into the server-side and got more and more absorbed in programming as a hobby. Even during the exam period of the first semester, I got deeply into Rails, neglecting my studies.

I haven't written an article about the first semester's grades, but as mentioned earlier, my obsession with coding led to a noticeable number of failed credits. As for the grades I received for the second semester of the third year, the number of failed credits increased further.

During the second semester, although I wasn't as absorbed in coding as in the first semester, I started to take an interest in networking, security, and server construction. The fun of these hobbies made me less and less motivated towards classes, which I think was a cause of the noticeable fails.

Before starting exam studies for the second semester, I imagined a fail rate of about 70-80%. I had completely skipped the middle and the end portions of some classes and had abandoned reports and weekly assignments for some courses, making it impossible to understand what to study even if I wanted to. Even if I got good scores during the final exams, I might not earn credits for courses with reports and assignments.

#### Sense of Panic
However, as the exams came closer, I was overcome with an extreme sense of panic thinking **this cannot go on**. Failing 70-80% would make my fourth year extremely challenging, with graduation research overlapping with credit acquisition.

Panicking, I finally started to get serious before the exams. Yet, not knowing what to study remained unchanged, but I had to do it. Saying so, I began reading textbooks from scratch for subjects where there was even a slight chance of earning credits.

"Reading the entire textbook for the first time right before the exams, are you an idiot?" you might think. I'm an idiot, I think so too. But if you haven't attended classes and don't have friends around to get exam information, there's really no other way.

#### The Hellish Two Weeks
Because of this, the study period before the exams during the second semester of my third year was extremely tough for me. The sense of panic was there, but I was still not focused due to being consumed by hobbies.

How many times did I feel like giving up during exam studies? I wanted to escape from this situation, but thinking that there would be no turning back if I ran away now, I desperately read textbooks.

Of course, just reading textbooks wasn't enough; solving problems was necessary to score good marks. In this sense, I was significantly behind in terms of time as I needed to read textbooks (being behind in what? Of course, it's a battle to earn credits).

Facing a significant lack of time, I kept pushing forward. Without thinking unnecessary thoughts, just persistently. Since I had just been assigned to a lab, there were days when I would sit at my lab desk from around noon until after 1 AM. During that period, because it was just before the submission of bachelor's or master's theses, I worked desperately among fourth-year and second-year master's seniors. In fact, I spent much longer there than the seniors time-wise, probably making them wonder why I was so serious even before writing a thesis. However, for me, that's how far I had to go to avoid serious trouble.

On the day of the exams, I felt quite tense like I never had before, but thanks to reading textbooks and studying comprehensively, I was able to finish exams in subjects I studied without any major stumbling blocks. But for the 3-4 subjects I hadn't studied for, I had missed so many classes, and assignments were completely hopeless, I judged it was impossible, so I didn't even take those exams.

#### As Expected Results
After approximately two months post-exams, I finally received my grades today. As expected, I failed the subjects I didn't take exams for, but for the subjects I put my all into before the exams, I received reasonably good evaluations as if my efforts were rewarded. Among them, despite skipping classes and nearly not submitting assignments, some subjects saw good evaluations thanks to the dozens of hours spent studying pre-exams.

Although it was really hellish before the exams, I realized that if a person puts their mind to it, surprisingly, it is possible to manage somehow. However, I do not intend to experience that hell again. I plan to obtain the remaining credits by attending classes properly, submitting assignments if there are any, and planning ahead for success.

### Likelihood of Graduation
So, I'm moving into my fourth year in April, but the question is whether I can graduate and whether I'm lacking any necessary credits. As of now, I'm still lacking credits. Despite studying hard before the exams, I did indeed miss credits for several subjects, so I'm certainly lacking. In fact, I understood this even before studying. Nevertheless, I think I would have been in a much worse situation without studying and earning at least some credits.

Fortunately, before awakening to the joy of coding and other server-related hobbies, in my first and second years, I was steadily earning credits and thus have been helped by that accumulation, and the remaining credits aren't too much of a burden for me to earn in my fourth year.

Specifically, I need **12 more credits**. Perhaps for those who were diligent in attending classes, this would seem like too much. However, internally, I'm relieved that it's not an entirely despairing amount (considering how much class I skipped).

These 12 credits include graduation research for both the first and second semesters, so omitting the research aspect, the credits I must still individually earn amount to 8. These divide into 2 general education credits and 6 specialized credits, totaling 8 credits.

### Discrepancy in Credit Count
Before starting this article, I went to the office to verify, and now it's resolved, but I was confused when I saw the credit breakdown in the grade report.

Subtracting the current credits I earned from the required credits for graduation equals **10 credits**. But looking at the breakdown, as mentioned earlier, it's 2 general credits + 6 specialized credits + 4 research credits, equaling **12 credits** needed.

Huh, the calculations don't match. After confirming with the office, it turned out that I had been taking **more credits than required for courses in math, English, and certification subjects**, which is why the calculations didn't match. In other words, while I still needed to acquire credits from general and specialized courses, I had taken extra credits elsewhere.

So, by the time I graduate, I will have at least the required credits plus 2. Of course, when registering for courses from now on, I plan to take extra credits just in case, so if all goes well, I might be acquiring quite a few additional credits.

There's absolutely no issue in acquiring extra credits, but it's rather foolish to be lacking in the courses you are supposed to take while taking extras elsewhere. For those planning your course schedule, make sure to properly calculate and secure your credits.

### Words to the Juniors
To sum it up in one word, "**Don't become a senior like me!**" is what I say. Please keep it in mind.

While it's too brief, if I say it gently, as those who have read this far already know, becoming too engrossed in hobbies and drifting even once from essential studies, it's easy to start rushing into a hell of missed credits. Especially with programming and server building, **because they relate to one's field of study, there's an added temptation to justify them as "a form of study,"** so please be truly cautious.

Even if it's said to be cautious, if one could do it initially, they'd be doing it already, but engaging in programming and other hobbies, in essence, is mere amusement when it comes to securing university credits—neglecting studies due to passion is no different than skipping for games (at least it was for me). So if you find yourself justifying it, question if it's truly valid.

For those who can actively engage in programming and still fulfill their studies, my words might sound ludicrous. But I wasn't diligent enough to balance both.

Of course, it's never about saying, "to avoid neglecting studies, curb your programming time." Rather, invest more in programming, fortifying your skills as an engineer. My point is, **although one may enhance skills with programming, it is no excuse for neglecting studies**.

### Conclusion
In the end, I’m relieved that the results I feared weren’t disastrous. To ensure, in both the first and second semesters, I plan to register for courses abundantly, especially needing to be prudent in the final year to avoid falling short. Practically, the goal is to secure the credits by the end of the first semester so that by the time credits are sufficient, we can drop registered courses.

Unrelatedly, before receiving my grades at the course guidance meeting, there was an award presentation by the educational support committee. Last year, as mentioned in the "[I Went to Receive My Grade Report](https://noraworld.blog/2nd-grade-2nd-semester-record/)" article, I was awarded for outstanding laboratory reports and tried submitting again this year, but I wasn’t awarded this time.

Unexpectedly, this turned into a lengthy piece, almost poetry-like, but with this, I conclude this episode on receiving my grades.
