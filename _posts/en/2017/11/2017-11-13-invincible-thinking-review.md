I finished reading "Invincible Thinking," a book by Hiroyuki Nishimura, known for creating 2channel, and I'd like to share some brief impressions.

I'm really bad at writing impressions of books or stories and I hated the homework for book reports when I was in elementary school. Also, I hardly ever read books usually. However, recently I've found enjoyment in reading, and since I, a person who typically doesn't read, have finished a book, I thought I'd write down my impressions as a record. So, to be honest, the content may still seem quite superficial, but please bear with me.

### What kind of book is it?
This book teaches you ways of thinking that are advantageous for living and that "money â‰  happiness." It shares viewpoints on how to be happy and the role of money.

It consists of three major chapters: Chapter 1 is about the "Rules of Thinking" that alone can make you happy, Chapter 2 is about the "Rules of Abilities and Work" that can make you win, and Chapter 3 is about the "Rules of Money" that can help you avoid loss.

### Chapter 1: The "Rules of Thinking" that alone can make you happy
Chapter 1 discusses the kind of thinking that can be advantageous. For example, Hiroyuki says that those who fulfill their desires by spending money are less likely to be happy.

If you need money for hobbies or what you want to do, you have to earn money not only for living expenses but also for doing what you want.

As a result, the "running cost" for enjoying life becomes high, leading to the need to work a lot. But is that happiness?

One answer to how to be happy is making things.

Creating things allows you to have fun without spending money. Of course, you might need pens to draw or equipment to make music, but creating itself is free.

People who make things as a hobby don't spend money on it, find happiness in creating, and if others appreciate what they've made, it brings even more joy.

If you can only find happiness as a consumer, money keeps decreasing, and you need to work more for it.

Personally, I don't spend much on hobbies. I like watching YouTube and coding. I enjoy making services or little tools I want, and sometimes get positive feedback from people when I share them, so I can have fun without spending money. This is something I already practice, but the book mentions many other advantageous ways of thinking.

### Chapter 2: The "Rules of Abilities and Work" that can make you win
Chapter 2 discusses how to work in a way that leads to happiness. It's not about any specific job but rather considerations related to work style and job selection.

One of the standout theories is that choosing a job purely based on salary often doesn't lead to good outcomes. High-paying jobs can either be those that "require exceptional ability" or those that need high salaries to attract people. The latter tend to have worsening situations in the medium to long term.

I'll leave the detailed theory to the book, but it made sense to me. I was conscious of starting salaries during my job search, but realized that focusing on it too much might be risky.

It also advises not relying on job rankings, and the reasoning is quite convincing. Essentially, students often judge based on salaries or company popularity rankings, but making decisions based solely on these superficial indicators isn't ideal.

Additionally, it warns about jobs that don't require skills being risky. Rather than aiming to join a company just because it's generally seen as a good one, it's better to hone your skills and find a company that suits you. Pursuing the option of changing jobs for that reason seems reasonable.

### Chapter 3: The "Rules of Money" that help you avoid loss
Chapter 3 discusses perspectives on money to avoid loss. What particularly convinced me was the advice to not escape into the comfort of keeping a budget out of reassurance.

To put it simply, if you look back at your budget later and think a certain expense was wasteful, then you shouldn't have bought it in the first place. Spending occurs the moment you buy, so hindsight is too late. You should decide whether it's wasteful before you buy.

I've experienced this myself. I used to watch product reviews on YouTube, think something looked good, buy it, but then stop using it weeks later and wonder why I even bought it.

Whether buying in-store or online, if you don't thoroughly consider why you need something before purchasing, you risk wasteful spending.

As an extension of this thinking, escaping into the reassurance of budgeting can lead to lingering wasteful spending, which I found to be an insightful point.

Moreover, there's a common belief that an annual income of 10 million yen makes you well-off. But the book challenges whether one can truly live a wealthy life with such an income, prompting reconsiderations about money.

### Impressions
After a quick introduction to the book, I have to say it was very interesting. Not only do you understand what Hiroyuki thinks, but there are many agreeable and insightful points.

Of course, not everything can be empathized with or emulated. I'm quite particular, and unless someone shares very similar values, I find it hard to live with others. So, skills like squatting to live cheaply probably aren't for me.

Well, you don't have to follow everything from the book blindly, nor do you need to. I'd like to practice what I find agreeable and worth trying.

In terms of the book's readability, it's very accessible. Even as someone who doesn't usually read, I found it smooth going. You could finish it in a day if you have the time. It doesn't use complex concepts or language, making it recommended even for those who struggle with difficult books.

### Conclusion
I'll wrap up my impressions of "Invincible Thinking" here. As I wrote, I realized I'm really not good at writing impressions (lol), but it's such an easy and interesting read that I encourage you to try it out.

Moreover, having finished this book, I've started to find pleasure in reading, and I might continue to buy and read books in the future. However, whether I'll write reviews again is uncertain. The writing can feel inadequate and disappointing (lol).
